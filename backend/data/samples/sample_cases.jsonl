SP No. 58038 dismissing petitioners' petition for\ncertiorari\n.\nThe factual background of the case is as follows:\nOn February 11, 1994, private respondent Janice Young-Chua and her husband, Eduardo Chan-Chua, filed a complaint for replevin and damages against petitioners William Madarang and Evans Kho in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-94-19266 and raffled to Branch 84 (RTC, Branch 84). The complaint alleged that private respondent is the owner of a 1990 dark gray Kia Pride car, evidenced by Certificate of Registration No. 08605800\n[2]\ndated May 31, 1991; and that on January 29, 1994, petitioners, through force and intimidation, took possession of the subject car by virtue of a falsified Deed of Sale dated December 3, 1993 allegedly executed by private respondent in favor of petitioner Madarang.\n[3]\nOn May 12, 1994, upon complaint of private respondent, petitioner Madarang was charged with Falsification of Public Document in the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City (MeTC) which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 94-24930 and raffled to Branch 32.\n[4]\nOn the same date, petitioners were charged with Grave Coercion in the same MeTC which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 94-24931, also raffled to Branch 32.\n[5]\nThe cases were consolidated and jointly tried.\nOn August 8, 1996, a Motion to Suspend Criminal Proceedings on the ground of prejudicial question was filed by petitioner Madarang in the MeTC, claiming that the issues presented in the replevin case pending in RTC, Branch 84 are intimately related to the issues pending before the MeTC, the resolution of which would necessarily determine the guilt of the accused in the criminal case for falsification.\n[6]\nOn October 1, 1996, the MeTC denied petitioner Madarang's motion to suspend proceedings on the ground that the decision in the civil case for replevin will not be determinative of the guilt of the accused in the criminal charge for falsification.\n[7]\nOn March 7, 1997, RTC, Branch 84 dismissed the complaint for replevin upon finding that the deed of sale is genuine and that private respondent voluntarily surrendered possession of the car to the petitioners.\n[8]\nPrivate respondent filed a timely appeal with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 57597.\nOn June 13, 1997, petitioner Madarang filed a Motion to Dismiss the falsification case on the ground that the decision dismissing the replevin suit in RTC, Branch 84 involving the same parties absolved him of criminal liability in the falsification case.\n[9]\nOn January 22, 1998, the MeTC granted the Motion to Dismiss of petitioner Madarang.\n[10]\nOn February 27, 1998, a Motion for Reconsideration was filed by the prosecution on the ground that the dismissal was unwarranted since the decision dismissing the replevin suit in RTC, Branch 84 is not yet final and executory, as it is pending appeal before the CA and the accused deliberately omitted to send the private prosecutor a copy of said Motion to Dismiss.\n[11]\nOn July 27, 1998, the MeTC recalled the dismissal of the case for falsification.\n[12]\nPetitioners filed a Second Omnibus Motion to Quash Criminal Case Nos. 94-24930 and 94-24931 on the ground that the findings of RTC, Branch 84 that the signature of private respondent in the deed of sale is not falsified and that private respondent voluntarily surrendered possession of the car to the petitioners bar the prosecution for falsification and grave coercion. Petitioners alleged that the findings of the RTC are binding and must be given due respect by the MeTC notwithstanding the appeal taken by private respondent.\n[13]\nIn its Opposition, the prosecution alleged that: the motion to quash is a mere scrap of paper as it is contrary to Section 1, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court that a Motion to Quash must be filed before arraignment of accused and such failure to move to quash before entering his plea, accused is deemed to have waived his right to file the same; and, the replevin suit is an independent civil action, separate and distinct from these cases for falsification of public document and grave coercion.\n[14]\nOn March 26, 1999, the MeTC denied petitioners' motion to quash, ruling that the decision rendered by the RTC, Branch 84 in the replevin case cannot absolve petitioners of the charges in the criminal cases as said decision has not attained finality since it is pending appeal before the CA; and that petitioners waived any grounds of a Motion to Quash pursuant to Section 1, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.\n[15]\nPetitioners then filed a petition for\ncertiorari\nbefore the RTC, Branch 77, Quezon City (RTC, Branch 77), docketed as Civil Case No. Q-99-37324. They assailed the MeTC's denial of their motion to quash the informations for falsification of public document and grave coercion and alleged that the MeTC should have adopted the factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 in the Decision dated March 7, 1997 in the replevin case as\nres judicata\n.\n[16]\nOn October 8, 1999, the RTC, Branch 77 dismissed petitioners' petition for\ncertiorari\nupon holding that:\nres judicata\ncannot be invoked considering that the Decision dated March 7, 1997 of RTC, Branch 84 in the replevin case is not yet a final and executory judgment, being on appeal; in any event, a final judgment rendered in a civil action absolving the defendant from civil liability is not a bar to criminal action; the issues of falsification and coercion were not made the subject of a full-dressed hearing in the replevin case; and, the motion to quash was filed only after their arraignment in violation of the well-settled doctrine that a motion to quash may be filed only before the accused has entered his plea to the accusatory pleading.\n[17]\nPetitioners' filed a motion for reconsideration\n[18]\nbut was denied in an Order dated February 29, 2000.\n[19]\nUndaunted, petitioners filed a petition for\ncertiorari\nbefore the CA which, on April 18, 2000, was dismissed. In dismissing the petition, the CA held that the writ of\ncertiorari\nis not the proper remedy where a motion to quash an information is denied. It further held that the People of the Philippines was not impleaded as a respondent in the case nor was the Office of the Solicitor General furnished a copy of the petition when the Informations were filed in the name of the People of the Philippines and necessarily it is the party interested in sustaining the proceedings in the court.\n[20]\nHence, the present petition for review on\ncertiorari\nanchored on the following grounds:\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED THE ISSUES PRESENTED PROBABLY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS SO FAR DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OR SO FAR SANCTIONED SUCH DEPARTURE BY THE LOWER COURT AS TO CALL FOR AN EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF SUPERVISION.\n[21]\nPetitioners claim that the MeTC Judge committed grave abuse of discretion when she denied their motion to quash the Informations and refused to dismiss the charges against them since the charges against them pending before her court were \"obliterated\" by the positive factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 that the signature of private respondent in the Deed of Sale dated December 3, 1993 is genuine and she voluntarily surrendered the car to petitioners. They maintain that such factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 bar their prosecution in the criminal cases for falsification of public document and grave coercion. They submit that once a court of competent jurisdiction puts to finish an issue of fact, it cannot be disturbed by the lower court and, \nHowever, records before us do not show that this decision had become final and executory. As a natural or inherent and inevitable consequence of said declaration, a decision which has not become final and executory has no conclusive effect.\nThird\n. Section 3, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure, the governing law at the time of the filing of the indictments, provides the grounds on which an accused can move to quash the complaint or information. These are: (a) the facts charged do not constitute an offense; (b) the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged; (c) the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the person of the accused; (d) the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so; (e) the information does not conform substantially to the prescribed form; (f) more than one offense is charged, except in those cases in which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various offenses; (g) the criminal action or liability has been extinguished; (h) the information contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and (i) the accused has been previously convicted or is in jeopardy of being convicted or acquitted of the offense charged.\n[25]\nSection 8 of the same Rule specifically provides:\nSEC. 8.\nFailure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor\n.—The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of the grounds of a motion to quash, except the grounds of no offense charged, lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty and jeopardy, as provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (f) and (h) of Section 3 of this Rule. (10a)\nThus, a motion to quash may still be filed after pleading to the complaint or information where the grounds are that no offense is charged, lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty and jeopardy. Nowhere in the enumerated excepted grounds is there any mention of\nres judicata\nas a ground to quash an information.\nFourth\n. Section 4, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court explicitly recognizes that \"a final judgment rendered in a civil action absolving the defendant from civil liability is no bar to a criminal action.\"\n[26]\nFifth\n. Article 33\n[27]\nof the Civil Code provides that in cases involving alleged fraudulent acts, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party. Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution and shall require only a preponderance of evidence. It is clear, therefore, that the civil case for replevin may proceed independently of the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion, especially because while both cases are based on the same facts, the quantum of proof required for holding the parties liable therein differs.\n[28]\nAll told, the petitioners failed to show why the actions of the MeTC, RTC and the CA which have passed upon the same issue should be reversed. We are thus convinced that the CA committed no reversible error in its challenged Decision.\n, the present petition is\n. The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated April 18, 2000, is\n.

    "ruling": "accordingly, the factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 cannot be overturned by the MeTC.\nThe Solicitor General, on the other hand, avers that the decision in the replevin suit cannot foreclose or suspend the prosecution of the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion as replevin is an entirely separate and distinct remedy allowed by the rules. He states that\nres judicata\ncannot apply for lack of the essential elements of identity of parties and finality of the decision in the replevin suit.\nAs for private respondent, she argues that the decision of RTC, Branch 84 can not be conclusive upon the MeTC because it is not a final and executory judgment, being on appeal in the CA, and, even if final, the rules provide that such final decision does not foreclose prosecution of the criminal action. She insists that the MeTC Judge did not act beyond her jurisdiction as the denial of the motion to quash was in accordance with law and jurisprudence and, thus, petitioners' resort to\ncertiorari\nwas improper and appropriately dismissed by the RTC and the CA.\nAt the outset, we observe that while the assigned errors appear to raise errors of judgment committed by the CA, the arguments of the petitioners purely dwell on the alleged grave abuse of discretion or error of jurisdiction committed by the MeTC in denying the Motion to Quash, the very issue they raised in the petition for\ncertiorari\nbefore the RTC, when the issues that should have been raised in the petition for review on\ncertiorari\nbefore us are the errors of judgment that the CA may have committed in dismissing their petition for\ncertiorari\n. Petitioners' utter failure to bring up the matter concerning the CA's bases in dismissing their petition shows that they are evading the issues.\nNonetheless, we find that the CA is correct in dismissing petitioners' petition for\ncertiorari\n.\nFirst\n. We note that the petitions for\ncertiorari\nin the RTC and CA are defective since petitioners failed to implead the People of the Philippines as respondent therein. As provided in Section 5,\n[22]\nRule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor. The prosecution of offenses is thus the concern of the government prosecutors. It behooved the petitioners to implead the People of the Philippines as respondent in the RTC and in the CA to enable the public prosecutor or Solicitor General, as the case may be, to comment on the petitions. The failure to implead is fatal to petitioners' cause.\nSecond.\nIt is settled that a special civil action for\ncertiorari\nand prohibition is not the proper remedy to assail the denial of a motion to quash an information. The established rule is that when such an adverse interlocutory order is rendered, the remedy is not to resort forthwith to\ncertiorari\nor prohibition, but to continue with the case in due course and, when an unfavorable verdict is handed down to take an appeal in the manner authorized by law.\n[23]\nOnly when the court issued such order without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and when the assailed interlocutory order is patently erroneous and the remedy of appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief will\ncertiorari\nbe considered an appropriate remedy to assail an interlocutory order.\n[24]\nNo such special circumstances are present in the case at bar.\nThe declaration of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 that the signature of private respondent in the Deed of Sale dated December 3, 1993 is genuine and she voluntarily surrendered the car to petitioners is not\nres judicata\nin the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion because there is no identity of parties as the People of the Philippines is not a party in the replevin suit and cannot be bound by the factual findings therein. Besides, the decision of RTC, Branch 84 is still pending appeal with the CA. Hence, at the time the MeTC, the RTC and the CA rendered their assailed order, decision and resolution, respectively, there existed no special circumstance to warrant a dismissal of the cases pending in the MeTC.\nIt is noted that during the pendency of the case before us, the CA has rendered a Decision dated April 19, 2005 modifying the Decision dated March 7, 1997 of RTC, Branch 84, in this wise:\nWHEREFORE, the application for a Writ of Replevin is hereby DENIED, the plaintiff Janice Chua having executed a Deed of Sale in favor of defendant William Madarang.\nThe Deed of Sale is however, hereby declared as an equitable mortgage and, therefore, plaintiff Janice Chua possesses the right of redemption pursuant to Article 1606 of the New Civil Code.\nSO ORDERED.",

It further held that the People of the Philippines was not impleaded as a respondent in the case nor was the Office of the Solicitor General furnished a copy of the petition when the Informations were filed in the name of the People of the Philippines and necessarily it is the party interested in sustaining the proceedings in the court.\n[20]\nHence, the present petition for review on\ncertiorari\nanchored on the following grounds:\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED THE ISSUES PRESENTED PROBABLY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS SO FAR DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OR SO FAR SANCTIONED SUCH DEPARTURE BY THE LOWER COURT AS TO CALL FOR AN EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF SUPERVISION.\n[21]\nPetitioners claim that the MeTC Judge committed grave abuse of discretion when she denied their motion to quash the Informations and refused to dismiss the charges against them since the charges against them pending before her court were \"obliterated\" by the positive factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 that the signature of private respondent in the Deed of Sale dated December 3, 1993 is genuine and she voluntarily surrendered the car to petitioners. They maintain that such factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 bar their prosecution in the criminal cases for falsification of public document and grave coercion. They submit that once a court of competent jurisdiction puts to finish an issue of fact, it cannot be disturbed by the lower court and, accordingly, the factual findings of RTC, Branch 84 cannot be overturned by the MeTC.\nThe Solicitor General, on the other hand, avers that the decision in the replevin suit cannot foreclose or suspend the prosecution of the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion as replevin is an entirely separate and distinct remedy allowed by the rules. He states that\nres judicata\ncannot apply for lack of the essential elements of identity of parties and finality of the decision in the replevin suit.\nAs for private respondent, she argues that the decision of RTC, Branch 84 can not be conclusive upon the MeTC because it is not a final and executory judgment, being on appeal in the CA, and, even if final, the rules provide that such final decision does not foreclose prosecution of the criminal action. She insists that the MeTC Judge did not act beyond her jurisdiction as the denial of the motion to quash was in accordance with law and jurisprudence and, thus, petitioners' resort to\ncertiorari\nwas improper and appropriately dismissed by the RTC and the CA.\nAt the outset, we observe that while the assigned errors appear to raise errors of judgment committed by the CA, the arguments of the petitioners purely dwell on the alleged grave abuse of discretion or error of jurisdiction committed by the MeTC in denying the Motion to Quash, the very issue they raised in the petition for\ncertiorari\nbefore the RTC, when the issues that should have been raised in the petition for review on\ncertiorari\nbefore us are the errors of judgment that the CA may have committed in dismissing their petition for\ncertiorari\n. Petitioners' utter failure to bring up the matter concerning the CA's bases in dismissing their petition shows that they are evading the issues.\nNonetheless, we find that the CA is correct in dismissing petitioners' petition for\ncertiorari\n.\nFirst\n. We note that the petitions for\ncertiorari\nin the RTC and CA are defective since petitioners failed to implead the People of the Philippines as respondent therein. As provided in Section 5,\n[22]\nRule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor. The prosecution of offenses is thus the concern of the government prosecutors. It behooved the petitioners to implead the People of the Philippines as respondent in the RTC and in the CA to enable the public prosecutor or Solicitor General, as the case may be, to comment on the petitions. The failure to implead is fatal to petitioners' cause.\nSecond.\nIt is settled that a special civil action for\ncertiorari\nand prohibition is not the proper remedy to assail the denial of a motion to quash an information. The established rule is that when such an adverse interlocutory order is rendered, the remedy is not to resort forthwith to\ncertiorari\nor prohibition, but to continue with the case in due course and, when an unfavorable verdict is handed down to take an appeal in the manner authorized by law.\n[23]\nOnly when the court issued such order without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and when the assailed interlocutory order is patently erroneous and the remedy of appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief will\ncertiorari\nbe considered an appropriate remedy to assail an interlocutory order.\n[24]\nNo such special circumstances are present in the case at bar.\nThe declaration of RTC, Branch 84 in its Decision dated March 7, 1997 that the signature of private respondent in the Deed of Sale dated December 3, 1993 is genuine and she voluntarily surrendered the car to petitioners is not\nres judicata\nin the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion because there is no identity of parties as the People of the Philippines is not a party in the replevin suit and cannot be bound by the factual findings therein. Besides, the decision of RTC, Branch 84 is still pending appeal with the CA. Hence, at the time the MeTC, the RTC and the CA rendered their assailed order, decision and resolution, respectively, there existed no special circumstance to warrant a dismissal of the cases pending in the MeTC.\nIt is noted that during the pendency of the case before us, the CA has rendered a Decision dated April 19, 2005 modifying the Decision dated March 7, 1997 of RTC, Branch 84, in this wise:\nWHEREFORE, the application for a Writ of Replevin is hereby DENIED, the plaintiff Janice Chua having executed a Deed of Sale in favor of defendant William Madarang.\nThe Deed of Sale is however, hereby declared as an equitable mortgage and, therefore, plaintiff Janice Chua possesses the right of redemption pursuant to Article 1606 of the New Civil Code.\nSO ORDERED.\nHowever, records before us do not show that this decision had become final and executory. As a natural or inherent and inevitable consequence of said declaration, a decision which has not become final and executory has no conclusive effect.\nThird\n. Section 3, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure, the governing law at the time of the filing of the indictments, provides the grounds on which an accused can move to quash the complaint or information. These are: (a) the facts charged do not constitute an offense; (b) the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged; (c) the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the person of the accused; (d) the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so; (e) the information does not conform substantially to the prescribed form; (f) more than one offense is charged, except in those cases in which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various offenses; (g) the criminal action or liability has been extinguished; (h) the information contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and (i) the accused has been previously convicted or is in jeopardy of being convicted or acquitted of the offense charged.\n[25]\nSection 8 of the same Rule specifically provides:\nSEC. 8.\nFailure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor\n.—The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of the grounds of a motion to quash, except the grounds of no offense charged, lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty and jeopardy, as provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (f) and (h) of Section 3 of this Rule. (10a)\nThus, a motion to quash may still be filed after pleading to the complaint or information where the grounds are that no offense is charged, lack of jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty and jeopardy. Nowhere in the enumerated excepted grounds is there any mention of\nres judicata\nas a ground to quash an information.\nFourth\n. Section 4, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court explicitly recognizes that \"a final judgment rendered in a civil action absolving the defendant from civil liability is no bar to a criminal action.\"\n[26]\nFifth\n. Article 33\n[27]\nof the Civil Code provides that in cases involving alleged fraudulent acts, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party. Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution and shall require only a preponderance of evidence. It is clear, therefore, that the civil case for replevin may proceed independently of the criminal cases for falsification and grave coercion, especially because while both cases are based on the same facts, the quantum of proof required for holding the parties liable therein differs.\n[28]\nAll told, the petitioners failed to show why the actions of the MeTC, RTC and the CA which have passed upon the same issue should be reversed. We are thus convinced that the CA committed no reversible error in its challenged Decision.\n, the present petition is\n. The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated April 18, 2000, is\n.

Soriano in a complaint\n[1]\nfor disbarment dated May 5, 2003, filed with the Committee on Bar Discipline, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (\"IBP\"), with violation of Sections 245 and 246 of the Revised Administrative Code, Title IV, Chapter II, known as the Notarial Law.\nIn her Report, IBP Investigating Commissioner Milagros V. San Juan summarized the allegations of complainant as well as the answer of respondent in the following wise:\nIn her verified complaint, complainant made the following allegations: That on June 30, 2000, respondent Atty. Humberto B. Basco, Notary Public of Manila testified before the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 35, stating among others, that he allegedly notarized a Deed of Sale allegedly executed by complainant Josefina P. Soriano. He further testified that Josefina Soriano personally appeared before him when he notarized the Deed of Sale. Since complainant had never appeared before Notary Public Humberto B. Basco, had not seen much less received copy of the alleged contract, complainant requested for a copy of the alleged contract from the Office of the Clerk of Court and\nEx-Officio\nSheriff, Regional Trial Court of Manila concerning the aforementioned Deed of Sale. Clerk of Court VII Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia, issued a Certification dated February 11, 2003 certifying that the alleged Deed of Sale involving Josefina P. Soriano as vendor alleged to have been acknowledged before Notary Public Humberto B. Basco was not among the document submitted to said office (Annex \"A\" of Complaint). Complainant also received a certified true copy of the notarial register of Notary Public Basco which disclosed his failure to indicate the names of the witnesses, fees charged, the respective residence certificates of the parties to the documents which he notarized (Annex \"B\" of Complaint). Although Atty. Basco was duty bound to furnish to complainant a certified true copy of the alleged deed, he failed to do so despite demand therefor.\nRespondent filed his Answer on June 10, 2003. In his defense, respondent declared that on January 17, 1997, herein complainant together with her son, Marcial P. Soriano went to his office located at 234 City Hall Bldg. both carrying with them a duly pre-drafted deed of sale, contents whereof signified that complainant did convey to the son valuable property. Respondent further stated that he instructed his staff secretary, Ms. Elizabeth Roque-Sanchez, to effect the clerical entry of notarial particulars of the original and copies of the said mutually executed deed of sale. Respondent claim that his staff secretary of course, retained a copy for our file and advised complainant and her son to immediately return or call the office to furnish their respective Community Tax Certificate.\nOn October 7, 2004, the IBP Board of Governors passed\nCBD Resolution No. XVI-2004-402\n[2]\n, adopting the report of the Investigating Commissioner and approving the latter's recommendation that respondent's notarial commission be revoked and respondent be reprimanded and warned that a breach of his professional duties shall be dealt with more severely. Says the said report:\nThe issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the respondent is guilty of dereliction of duty as a notary public.\nThe certification issued by the Clerk of Court, Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia clearly show that the questioned document purportedly acknowledged before the respondent on 17 January 1997 and entered as Doc. No. 424 Page No. 21, Book No. 67, Series of 1997, was not among the documents submitted by said office (Annex \"A\" of the Complain).\nThe certified true copy of the notarial register of respondent disclosed that there is no entry regarding the names of the witnesses to the documents neither were the respective Community Tax Certificates of the parties indicated in the notarial register of respondent (Annex \"B\" of Complaint).\nThe respondent failed to furnish the complainant a copy of the alleged Deed of Sale despite the fact that respondent admitted having retained a copy of the document for their office file.\nRespondent delegated to his secretary the clerical entry to his records, evidently he failed to check the sufficiency of the notarial entries which explains the absence of the names of the witnesses and other pertinent data.\nNotably, the allegations of the complainant remain uncontroverted by the respondent. It is very evident that respondent in discharging the duties as notary public failed to exercise diligence in his performance of his responsibilities as such. Thus, it is recommended that respondent's notarial commission be revoked and the respondent be reprimanded and warned that a breach of his professional duties shall be dealt with more severely.\n[3]\nThe IBP Board of Governors' Resolution No. XVI-2004-402, now before the Court for final action, is well-taken.\nThe Notarial Law is explicit on the obligations and duties of a notary public. Sections 245 and 246 of the Revised Administrative Code respectively provide:\nSec. 245. Notarial Register. – Every notary public shall keep a register to be known as the notarial register, wherein record shall be made of all his official acts as notary; and he shall supply a certified copy of such record, or any part thereof, to any person applying for it and paying the legal fees therefor.\nSuch register shall be kept in books to be furnished by the Attorney-General (Solicitor General) to any notary public upon request and upon payment of the actual cost thereof, but officers exercising the functions of notaries public\nex-officio\nshall be supplied with the register at Government expense. The register shall be duly paged, and on the first page, the Attorney-General (Solicitor General) shall certify the number of pages of which the book consists.\nSec. 246. Matters to be entered therein. – The notary public shall enter in such register, in chronological order, the nature of each instrument executed, sworn to, or acknowledged before him, the person executing, swearing to or acknowledging the instrument, the witnesses, if any, to the signature, the date of the execution, oath, or acknowledgment of the instrument, the fees collected by him for his services as notary in connection therewith, and, when the instrument is a contract, he shall keep a correct copy thereof as part of his records, and shall likewise enter in said records a brief description of the substance thereof and shall give to each entry a consecutive number, beginning with number one in each calendar year. The notary shall give to each instrument executed, sworn to, or acknowledged before him a number corresponding to the one in his register, and shall also state on the instrument the page or pages of his register on which the same is recorded. No blank line shall be left between entries.\nxxx                   xxx                  xxx\nAt the end of each week the notary shall certify in his register the number of instruments executed, sworn to, acknowledged or protested before him; or if none such, the certificate shall show this fact.\nA certified copy of each month's entries as described in this section and a certified copy of any instrument acknowledged before them shall within the first ten days of the month next following be forwarded by the notaries public to the clerk of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of the province and shall be filed under the responsibility of such officer:\nProvided,\nThat if there is no entry to certify for the month, the notary shall forward a statement to this effect in lieu of the certified copies herein required.\nHere, Atty. Basco violated the Notarial Law by failing to provide all the necessary information regarding the questioned Deed of Sale entered in his notarial register. He even notarized said instrument even without the notation of the residence certificate of the party to the document. As a notary public, respondent is required by the Notarial Law to certify that the party to the instrument acknowledged before him has presented the proper residence certificate (or exemption from the residence certificate) and to enter its number, place of issue and date as part of the certification. Worse, he likewise failed to send copy of the notarized document to the clerk of court of the proper RTC and to retain a copy thereof for his own records. These formalities are mandatory and cannot simply be neglected. Failure to perform this duty results in the revocation of a notary's commission.\n[4]\nIn\nVda. de Rosales vs. Ramos\n,\n[5]\nwe held:\nX x x. The notarial registry is a record of the notary public's official acts. Acknowledged documents and instruments recorded in it are considered public documents. If the document or instrument does not appear in the notarial records and there is no copy of it therein, doubt is engendered that the document or instrument was not really notarized, so that it is not a public document and cannot bolster any claim made based on this document. Considering the evidentiary value given to notarized documents, the failure of the notary public to record the document in his notarial registry is tantamount to falsely making it appear that the document was notarized when in fact it was not. xxx. This is a clear violation of the Notarial Law for which he must be disciplined.\nWe have emphatically stressed that notarization is not an empty, meaningless, routinary act. On the contrary, it is invested with substantive public interest, such that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as notary public. Notarization of a private document converts it into a public instrument making it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face and, for this reason, notaries public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties, lest, the confidence of the public in the integrity of the document will be undermined.\n[6]\nAs a lawyer commissioned as a notary public, respondent is mandated to discharge with fidelity the sacred duties appertaining to his office, such duties being dictated by public policy and impressed with public interest. Faithful observance and utmost respect for the legal solemnity of an oath in an acknowledgment are sacrosanct. He cannot simply disregard the requirements and solemnities of the Notarial Law.\nIn\nProtacio vs. Mendoza\n,\n[7]\nthis Court suspended respondent's commission as a notary public for one (1) year for his failure to send to the Clerk of Court of the proper RTC the entries in his notarial registry.\n\nPanganiban, J., (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,\nand\nCarpio Morales JJ.,\nconcur.\n[1]\nRollo, pp. 1-3.\n[2]\nRollo, p. 130.\n[3]\nRollo, pp. 132-133.\n[4]\nSec. 249. Grounds for revocation of commission. – The following derelictions of duty on the part of a notary public shall, in the discretion of the proper judge of first instance, be sufficient ground for the revocation of the notarial commission, thus:\n(a)\nThe failure of the notary to keep a notarial register.\n(b)\nThe failure of the notary to make the proper entry or entries in his notarial register touching his notarial acts in the manner required by law.\n(c)\nThe failure of the notary to send the copy of the entries to the proper clerk of Court of First Instance(now Regional Trial Court) within the first ten days of the month next following.\n(d)\nThe failure of the notary to affix to acknowledgment the date of expiration of his commission, as required by law.\n(e)\nThe failure of the notary to forward his notarial register, when filled, to the proper clerk of court.\n(f)\nThe failure of the notary to make the proper notation regarding cedula certificates. (See C.A. 238, re abolition of cedula tax; see also C.A. 465, Sec. 6, re presentation of residence certificate by a person liable to pay residence tax when acknowledging document before a notary public.\n(g)\nThe failure of the notary to make the proper notation regarding cedula certificates.\n(h)\nAny other dereliction or act which shall appear to the judge to constitute good cause for removal.\n[5]\nA.C.

Basco, Notary Public of Manila testified before the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 35, stating among others, that he allegedly notarized a Deed of Sale allegedly executed by complainant Josefina P. Soriano. He further testified that Josefina Soriano personally appeared before him when he notarized the Deed of Sale. Since complainant had never appeared before Notary Public Humberto B. Basco, had not seen much less received copy of the alleged contract, complainant requested for a copy of the alleged contract from the Office of the Clerk of Court and\nEx-Officio\nSheriff, Regional Trial Court of Manila concerning the aforementioned Deed of Sale. Clerk of Court VII Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia, issued a Certification dated February 11, 2003 certifying that the alleged Deed of Sale involving Josefina P. Soriano as vendor alleged to have been acknowledged before Notary Public Humberto B. Basco was not among the document submitted to said office (Annex \"A\" of Complaint). Complainant also received a certified true copy of the notarial register of Notary Public Basco which disclosed his failure to indicate the names of the witnesses, fees charged, the respective residence certificates of the parties to the documents which he notarized (Annex \"B\" of Complaint). Although Atty. Basco was duty bound to furnish to complainant a certified true copy of the alleged deed, he failed to do so despite demand therefor.\nRespondent filed his Answer on June 10, 2003. In his defense, respondent declared that on January 17, 1997, herein complainant together with her son, Marcial P. Soriano went to his office located at 234 City Hall Bldg. both carrying with them a duly pre-drafted deed of sale, contents whereof signified that complainant did convey to the son valuable property. Respondent further stated that he instructed his staff secretary, Ms. Elizabeth Roque-Sanchez, to effect the clerical entry of notarial particulars of the original and copies of the said mutually executed deed of sale. Respondent claim that his staff secretary of course, retained a copy for our file and advised complainant and her son to immediately return or call the office to furnish their respective Community Tax Certificate.\nOn October 7, 2004, the IBP Board of Governors passed\nCBD Resolution No. XVI-2004-402\n[2]\n, adopting the report of the Investigating Commissioner and approving the latter's recommendation that respondent's notarial commission be revoked and respondent be reprimanded and warned that a breach of his professional duties shall be dealt with more severely. Says the said report:\nThe issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the respondent is guilty of dereliction of duty as a notary public.\nThe certification issued by the Clerk of Court, Jennifer H. Dela Cruz-Buendia clearly show that the questioned document purportedly acknowledged before the respondent on 17 January 1997 and entered as Doc. No. 424 Page No. 21, Book No. 67, Series of 1997, was not among the documents submitted by said office (Annex \"A\" of the Complain).\nThe certified true copy of the notarial register of respondent disclosed that there is no entry regarding the names of the witnesses to the documents neither were the respective Community Tax Certificates of the parties indicated in the notarial register of respondent (Annex \"B\" of Complaint).\nThe respondent failed to furnish the complainant a copy of the alleged Deed of Sale despite the fact that respondent admitted having retained a copy of the document for their office file.\nRespondent delegated to his secretary the clerical entry to his records, evidently he failed to check the sufficiency of the notarial entries which explains the absence of the names of the witnesses and other pertinent data.\nNotably, the allegations of the complainant remain uncontroverted by the respondent. It is very evident that respondent in discharging the duties as notary public failed to exercise diligence in his performance of his responsibilities as such. Thus, it is recommended that respondent's notarial commission be revoked and the respondent be reprimanded and warned that a breach of his professional duties shall be dealt with more severely.\n[3]\nThe IBP Board of Governors' Resolution No. XVI-2004-402, now before the Court for final action, is well-taken.\nThe Notarial Law is explicit on the obligations and duties of a notary public. Sections 245 and 246 of the Revised Administrative Code respectively provide:\nSec. 245. Notarial Register. – Every notary public shall keep a register to be known as the notarial register, wherein record shall be made of all his official acts as notary; and he shall supply a certified copy of such record, or any part thereof, to any person applying for it and paying the legal fees therefor.\nSuch register shall be kept in books to be furnished by the Attorney-General (Solicitor General) to any notary public upon request and upon payment of the actual cost thereof, but officers exercising the functions of notaries public\nex-officio\nshall be supplied with the register at Government expense. The register shall be duly paged, and on the first page, the Attorney-General (Solicitor General) shall certify the number of pages of which the book consists.\nSec. 246. Matters to be entered therein. – The notary public shall enter in such register, in chronological order, the nature of each instrument executed, sworn to, or acknowledged before him, the person executing, swearing to or acknowledging the instrument, the witnesses, if any, to the signature, the date of the execution, oath, or acknowledgment of the instrument, the fees collected by him for his services as notary in connection therewith, and, when the instrument is a contract, he shall keep a correct copy thereof as part of his records, and shall likewise enter in said records a brief description of the substance thereof and shall give to each entry a consecutive number, beginning with number one in each calendar year. The notary shall give to each instrument executed, sworn to, or acknowledged before him a number corresponding to the one in his register, and shall also state on the instrument the page or pages of his register on which the same is recorded. No blank line shall be left between entries.\nxxx                   xxx                  xxx\nAt the end of each week the notary shall certify in his register the number of instruments executed, sworn to, acknowledged or protested before him; or if none such, the certificate shall show this fact.\nA certified copy of each month's entries as described in this section and a certified copy of any instrument acknowledged before them shall within the first ten days of the month next following be forwarded by the notaries public to the clerk of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of the province and shall be filed under the responsibility of such officer:\nProvided,\nThat if there is no entry to certify for the month, the notary shall forward a statement to this effect in lieu of the certified copies herein required.\nHere, Atty. Basco violated the Notarial Law by failing to provide all the necessary information regarding the questioned Deed of Sale entered in his notarial register. He even notarized said instrument even without the notation of the residence certificate of the party to the document. As a notary public, respondent is required by the Notarial Law to certify that the party to the instrument acknowledged before him has presented the proper residence certificate (or exemption from the residence certificate) and to enter its number, place of issue and date as part of the certification. Worse, he likewise failed to send copy of the notarized document to the clerk of court of the proper RTC and to retain a copy thereof for his own records. These formalities are mandatory and cannot simply be neglected. Failure to perform this duty results in the revocation of a notary's commission.\n[4]\nIn\nVda. de Rosales vs. Ramos\n,\n[5]\nwe held:\nX x x. The notarial registry is a record of the notary public's official acts. Acknowledged documents and instruments recorded in it are considered public documents. If the document or instrument does not appear in the notarial records and there is no copy of it therein, doubt is engendered that the document or instrument was not really notarized, so that it is not a public document and cannot bolster any claim made based on this document. Considering the evidentiary value given to notarized documents, the failure of the notary public to record the document in his notarial registry is tantamount to falsely making it appear that the document was notarized when in fact it was not. xxx. This is a clear violation of the Notarial Law for which he must be disciplined.\nWe have emphatically stressed that notarization is not an empty, meaningless, routinary act. On the contrary, it is invested with substantive public interest, such that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as notary public. Notarization of a private document converts it into a public instrument making it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face and, for this reason, notaries public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties, lest, the confidence of the public in the integrity of the document will be undermined.\n[6]\nAs a lawyer commissioned as a notary public, respondent is mandated to discharge with fidelity the sacred duties appertaining to his office, such duties being dictated by public policy and impressed with public interest. Faithful observance and utmost respect for the legal solemnity of an oath in an acknowledgment are sacrosanct. He cannot simply disregard the requirements and solemnities of the Notarial Law.\nIn\nProtacio vs. Mendoza\n,\n[7]\nthis Court suspended respondent's commission as a notary public for one (1) year for his failure to send to the Clerk of Court of the proper RTC the entries in his notarial registry.\nWHEREFORE,\nfor breach of the notarial law, the commission of respondent Atty. Humberto B. Basco as Notary Public, if still existing, is\nand he is\nfrom being commissioned as such for a period of one (1) year with a\nthat a repetition of the same negligent act charged in the complaint will be dealt with more severely.\nLet copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.\nSO ORDERED.\nPanganiban, J., (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,\nand\nCarpio Morales JJ.,\nconcur.\n[1]\nRollo, pp. 1-3.\n[2]\nRollo, p. 130.\n[3]\nRollo, pp. 132-133.\n[4]\nSec. 249. Grounds for revocation of commission. – The following derelictions of duty on the part of a notary public shall, in the discretion of the proper judge of first instance, be sufficient ground for the revocation of the notarial commission, thus:\n(a)\nThe failure of the notary to keep a notarial register.\n(b)\nThe failure of the notary to make the proper entry or entries in his notarial register touching his notarial acts in the manner required by law.\n(c)\nThe failure of the notary to send the copy of the entries to the proper clerk of Court of First Instance(now Regional Trial Court) within the first ten days of the month next following.\n(d)\nThe failure of the notary to affix to acknowledgment the date of expiration of his commission, as required by law.\n(e)\nThe failure of the notary to forward his notarial register, when filled, to the proper clerk of court.\n(f)\nThe failure of the notary to make the proper notation regarding cedula certificates.

SPOUSES TONY AYON AND MERCY AYON, RESPONDENTS.\nSANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:\nFor our resolution is the petition for review on\ncertiorari\nassailing the Decision\n[1]\nof the Court of Appeals dated October 5, 1998 in CA-G.R. SP No. 4735 and its Resolution\n[2]\ndated December 11, 1998 denying the motion for reconsideration.\nThe petition alleges that on November 6, 1996, Ruben Santos, petitioner, filed with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 2, Davao City a complaint for illegal detainer against spouses Tony and Mercy Ayon, respondents, docketed as Civil Case No. 3506-B-96.\nIn his complaint, petitioner averred that he is the registered owner of three lots situated at Lanzona Subdivision, Matina, Davao City, covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 108174, 108175, and 108176. Respondent spouses are the registered owners of an adjacent parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-247792. The previous occupant of this property built a building which straddled both the lots of the herein parties. Respondents have been using the building as a warehouse.\nPetitioner further alleged in his complaint that in 1985, when he bought the three lots, he informed respondents that the building occupies a portion of his land. However, he allowed them to continue using the building. But in 1996, he needed the entire portion of his lot, hence, he demanded that respondents demolish and remove the part of the building encroaching his property and turn over to him their possession. But they refused. Instead, they continued occupying the contested portion and even made improvements on the building. The dispute was then referred to the\nbarangay lupon,\nbut the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement. \"\n[3]\nOn appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 11, Davao City, in its Decision dated February 12, 1998 in Civil Case No. 25, 654-97, affirmed\nin toto\nthe MTCC judgment.\n[4]\nThe RTC upheld the finding of the MTCC that respondents' occupation of the contested portion was by mere tolerance. Hence, when petitioner needed the same, he has the right to eject them through court action.\nRespondents then elevated the case to the Court of Appeals through a petition for review. In its Decision dated October 5, 1988 now being challenged by petitioner, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's proper remedy should have been an\naccion publiciana\nbefore the RTC, not an action for unlawful detainer, thus:\n\"In this case, petitioners were already in possession of the premises in question at the time private respondent bought three (3) lots at the Lanzona Subdivision in 1985, a portion of which is occupied by a building being used by the former as a bodega. Apart from private respondent's bare claim, no evidence was alluded to show that petitioners' possession was tolerated by (his) predecessor-in-interest. The fact that respondent might have tolerated petitioners' possession is not decisive. What matters for purposes of determining the proper cause of action is the nature of petitioners' possession from its inception. And in this regard, the Court notes that the complaint itself merely alleges that defendants-petitioners have been \"occupying a portion of the above properties of the plaintiff for the past several years by virtue of the tolerance of the plaintiff.\" Nowhere is it alleged that his predecessor likewise tolerated petitioners' possession of the premises. x x x.\nConsequently, x x x, respondent should present his claim before the Regional Trial Court in an\naccion publiciana\nand not before the Municipal Trial Court in a summary proceeding of unlawful detainer.\nWHEREFORE, the decision under review is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the complaint for unlawful detainer is ordered DISMISSED.\"\n[5]\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, but was denied by the Appellate Court in its Resolution dated December 11, 1998.\nHence, the instant petition for review on certiorari ascribing to the Court of Appeals the following errors:\n\"I\n.\nTHE FINDINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IS NOT IN CONSONANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE.\"\nThe sole issue here is whether the Court of Appeals committed a reversible error of law in holding that petitioner's complaint is within the competence of the RTC, not the MTCC.\nPetitioner contends that it is not necessary that he has prior physical possession of the questioned property before he could file an action for unlawful detainer. He stresses that he tolerated respondents\" occupancy of the portion in controversy until he needed it. After his demand that they vacate, their continued possession became illegal. Hence, his action for unlawful detainer before the MTCC is proper.\nRespondents, in their comment, insisted that they have been in possession of the disputed property even before petitioner purchased the same on April 10, 1985. Hence, he cannot claim that they were occupying the property by mere tolerance because they were ahead in time in physical possession.\nWe sustain the petition.\nIt is an elementary rule that the jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the complaint and cannot be made to depend upon the defenses set up in the answer or pleadings filed by the defendant.\n[6]\nThis rule is no different in an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer.\n[7]\nAll actions for forcible entry or unlawful detainer shall be filed with the proper Metropolitan Trial Courts, the Municipal Trial Courts and the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, which actions shall include not only the plea for restoration of possession but also all claims for damages and costs arising therefrom.\n[8]\nThe said courts are not divested of jurisdiction over such cases even if the defendants therein raises the question of ownership over the litigated property in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership.\n[9]\nSection 1, Rule 70 on forcible entry and unlawful detainer of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, reads:\n\"Section 1.\nWho may institute proceedings, and when.\n– Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal representatives or assigns of any such lessor, vendor, vendee or other person may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper Municipal Trial Court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs.\"\nUnder the above provision, there are two entirely distinct and different causes of action, to wit: (1) a case for forcible entry, which is an action to recover possession of a property from the defendant whose occupation thereof is illegal from the beginning as he acquired possession by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth; and (2) a case for unlawful detainer, which is an action for recovery of possession from defendant whose possession of the property was inceptively lawful by virtue of a contract (express or implied) with the plaintiff, but became illegal when he continued his possession despite the termination of his right thereunder.\n[10]\nPetitioner's complaint for unlawful detainer in Civil Case No. 3506-B-96 is properly within the competence of the MTCC. His pertinent allegations in the complaint read:\n\"4. That defendants (spouses) have constructed an extension of their residential house as well as other structures and have been occupying a portion of the above PROPERTIES of the plaintiff for the past several years\nby virtue of the tolerance of the plaintiff since at the time he has no need of the property\n;\n5. That\nplaintiff needed the property in the early part of 1996 and made demands to the defendants to vacate and turn over the premises as well as the removal (of) their structures found inside the PROPERTIES of plaintiff; that without any justifiable reasons, defendants refused to vacate the portion of the PROPERTIES occupied by them to the damage and prejudice of the plaintiff.\n6. Hence, plaintiff referred the matter to the Office of the Barangay Captain of Matina Crossing 74-A, Davao City for a possible settlement sometime in the latter part of February 1996. The\nbarangay\ncase reached the\nPangka\nt but no settlement was had. Thereafter, a \"Certification To File Action\" dated March 27, 1996 was issued x x x;\nx x x.\"\n[11]\n(underscoring ours)\nVerily, petitioner's allegations in his complaint clearly make a case for an unlawful detainer. We find no error in the MTCC assuming jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint. A complaint for unlawful detainer is sufficient if it alleges that the withholding of the possession or the refusal to vacate is unlawful without necessarily employing the terminology of the law.\n[12]\nHere, there is an allegation in petitioner's complaint that respondents occupancy on the portion of his property is by virtue of his tolerance. Petitioner's cause of action for unlawful detainer springs from respondents' failure to vacate the questioned premises upon his demand sometime in 1996. Within one (1) year therefrom, or on November 6, 1996, petitioner filed the instant complaint.\nIt bears stressing that possession by tolerance is lawful, but such possession becomes unlawful when the possessor by tolerance refuses to vacate upon demand made by the owner. Our ruling in\nRoxas vs. Court of Appeals\n[13]\nis applicable in this case: \"A person who occupies the land of another at the latter's tolerance or permission, without any contract between them, is necessarily bound by an implied promise that he will vacate upon demand, failing which, a summary action for ejectment is the proper remedy against him.\"\nWHEREFORE,\nthe petition is\n. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 47435 are hereby\nand\nSET ASIDE.\nThe Decision dated February 12, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 11, Davao City in Civil Case No. 25, 654-97, affirming the Decision dated July 31, 1997 of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 2, Davao City in Civil Case No. 3506-B-96, is hereby\n.\n.\nPanganiban, (Chairman), Corona, Carpio-Morales,\nand\nGarcia, JJ.,\nconcur.\n[1]\nRollo, pp. 55-59.

Respondents denied they were occupying petitioner's property by mere tolerance, claiming they own the contested portion and have been occupying the same long before petitioner acquired his lots in 1985.\nOn July 31, 1997, the MTCC rendered its Decision in favor of petitioner, thus:\n\"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants ordering the latter, their successors-in-interest and other persons acting in their behalf to vacate the portion of the subject properties and peacefully surrender possession thereof to plaintiff as well as dismantle/remove the structures found thereon.\nDefendants are further ordered to pay reasonable value for the use and occupation of the encroached area in the amount of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) a month beginning September 1996 and the subsequent months thereafter until premises are vacated; to pay attorney's fees of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00); and to pay the costs of suit.\nSO ORDERED.\"\n[3]\nOn appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 11, Davao City, in its Decision dated February 12, 1998 in Civil Case No. 25, 654-97, affirmed\nin toto\nthe MTCC judgment.\n[4]\nThe RTC upheld the finding of the MTCC that respondents' occupation of the contested portion was by mere tolerance. Hence, when petitioner needed the same, he has the right to eject them through court action.\nRespondents then elevated the case to the Court of Appeals through a petition for review. In its Decision dated October 5, 1988 now being challenged by petitioner, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's proper remedy should have been an\naccion publiciana\nbefore the RTC, not an action for unlawful detainer, thus:\n\"In this case, petitioners were already in possession of the premises in question at the time private respondent bought three (3) lots at the Lanzona Subdivision in 1985, a portion of which is occupied by a building being used by the former as a bodega. Apart from private respondent's bare claim, no evidence was alluded to show that petitioners' possession was tolerated by (his) predecessor-in-interest. The fact that respondent might have tolerated petitioners' possession is not decisive. What matters for purposes of determining the proper cause of action is the nature of petitioners' possession from its inception. And in this regard, the Court notes that the complaint itself merely alleges that defendants-petitioners have been \"occupying a portion of the above properties of the plaintiff for the past several years by virtue of the tolerance of the plaintiff.\" Nowhere is it alleged that his predecessor likewise tolerated petitioners' possession of the premises. x x x.\nConsequently, x x x, respondent should present his claim before the Regional Trial Court in an\naccion publiciana\nand not before the Municipal Trial Court in a summary proceeding of unlawful detainer.\nWHEREFORE, the decision under review is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the complaint for unlawful detainer is ordered DISMISSED.\"\n[5]\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, but was denied by the Appellate Court in its Resolution dated December 11, 1998.\nHence, the instant petition for review on certiorari ascribing to the Court of Appeals the following errors:\n\"I\n.\nTHE FINDINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IS NOT IN CONSONANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE.\"\nThe sole issue here is whether the Court of Appeals committed a reversible error of law in holding that petitioner's complaint is within the competence of the RTC, not the MTCC.\nPetitioner contends that it is not necessary that he has prior physical possession of the questioned property before he could file an action for unlawful detainer. He stresses that he tolerated respondents\" occupancy of the portion in controversy until he needed it. After his demand that they vacate, their continued possession became illegal. Hence, his action for unlawful detainer before the MTCC is proper.\nRespondents, in their comment, insisted that they have been in possession of the disputed property even before petitioner purchased the same on April 10, 1985. Hence, he cannot claim that they were occupying the property by mere tolerance because they were ahead in time in physical possession.\nWe sustain the petition.\nIt is an elementary rule that the jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the complaint and cannot be made to depend upon the defenses set up in the answer or pleadings filed by the defendant.\n[6]\nThis rule is no different in an action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer.\n[7]\nAll actions for forcible entry or unlawful detainer shall be filed with the proper Metropolitan Trial Courts, the Municipal Trial Courts and the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, which actions shall include not only the plea for restoration of possession but also all claims for damages and costs arising therefrom.\n[8]\nThe said courts are not divested of jurisdiction over such cases even if the defendants therein raises the question of ownership over the litigated property in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership.\n[9]\nSection 1, Rule 70 on forcible entry and unlawful detainer of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, reads:\n\"Section 1.\nWho may institute proceedings, and when.\n– Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal representatives or assigns of any such lessor, vendor, vendee or other person may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper Municipal Trial Court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, together with damages and costs.\"\nUnder the above provision, there are two entirely distinct and different causes of action, to wit: (1) a case for forcible entry, which is an action to recover possession of a property from the defendant whose occupation thereof is illegal from the beginning as he acquired possession by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth; and (2) a case for unlawful detainer, which is an action for recovery of possession from defendant whose possession of the property was inceptively lawful by virtue of a contract (express or implied) with the plaintiff, but became illegal when he continued his possession despite the termination of his right thereunder.\n[10]\nPetitioner's complaint for unlawful detainer in Civil Case No. 3506-B-96 is properly within the competence of the MTCC. His pertinent allegations in the complaint read:\n\"4. That defendants (spouses) have constructed an extension of their residential house as well as other structures and have been occupying a portion of the above PROPERTIES of the plaintiff for the past several years\nby virtue of the tolerance of the plaintiff since at the time he has no need of the property\n;\n5. That\nplaintiff needed the property in the early part of 1996 and made demands to the defendants to vacate and turn over the premises as well as the removal (of) their structures found inside the PROPERTIES of plaintiff; that without any justifiable reasons, defendants refused to vacate the portion of the PROPERTIES occupied by them to the damage and prejudice of the plaintiff.\n6. Hence, plaintiff referred the matter to the Office of the Barangay Captain of Matina Crossing 74-A, Davao City for a possible settlement sometime in the latter part of February 1996. The\nbarangay\ncase reached the\nPangka\nt but no settlement was had. Thereafter, a \"Certification To File Action\" dated March 27, 1996 was issued x x x;\nx x x.\"\n[11]\n(underscoring ours)\nVerily, petitioner's allegations in his complaint clearly make a case for an unlawful detainer. We find no error in the MTCC assuming jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint. A complaint for unlawful detainer is sufficient if it alleges that the withholding of the possession or the refusal to vacate is unlawful without necessarily employing the terminology of the law.\n[12]\nHere, there is an allegation in petitioner's complaint that respondents occupancy on the portion of his property is by virtue of his tolerance. Petitioner's cause of action for unlawful detainer springs from respondents' failure to vacate the questioned premises upon his demand sometime in 1996. Within one (1) year therefrom, or on November 6, 1996, petitioner filed the instant complaint.\nIt bears stressing that possession by tolerance is lawful, but such possession becomes unlawful when the possessor by tolerance refuses to vacate upon demand made by the owner. Our ruling in\nRoxas vs. Court of Appeals\n[13]\nis applicable in this case: \"A person who occupies the land of another at the latter's tolerance or permission, without any contract between them, is necessarily bound by an implied promise that he will vacate upon demand, failing which, a summary action for ejectment is the proper remedy against him.\"\nWHEREFORE,\nthe petition is\n.

CV No. 54831, which reversed the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 18836, and its August 4, 2004 resolution denying reconsideration thereof.\nThe facts are as follows:\nDeogracias, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, all surnamed Militar, were heirs of Estanislao Militar and the registered co-owners of Lot Nos. 3011 and 3017 covered by OCT No. T-8238-A (0-16879) and OCT No. 94-(0-16878).\nOn August 16, 1941, Deogracias sold his undivided share in Lot No. 3011 to Pedro Golez, and in Lot No. 3017 to spouses Sofronio and Lourdes Lumagbas. Golez annotated the sale at the back of the title thereof while spouses Lumagbas caused the subdivision of Lot No. 3017 into Lot No. 3017-A and Lot No. 3017-B, with Lot No. 3017-A registered in their names under TCT No. 8239.\nNotwithstanding the sale, Deogracias continued to occupy a portion of Lot No. 3011 and Lot No. 3017-B until his death on March 17, 1964. Glicerio died on March 22, 1939, Tomas on August 20, 1959 and Caridad on April 29, 1957. Glicerio and Caridad died without issue. Deogracias was survived by Teodorico and Remedios, while Tomas was survived by Wenceslao and Ladislao.\nHowever, in a Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 24, 1975, Deogracias, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad purportedly sold Lot No. 3011 to spouses Rodolfo and Nilda Jalbuna. In another Deed of Sale dated April 25, 1975, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad purportedly sold Lot No. 3017-B to the same spouses. Consequently, titles to Lot Nos. 3011 and 3017-B were cancelled and new titles, TCT Nos. 39083 and 39082, respectively, were issued to spouses Jalbuna.\nSubsequently, Lot No. 3011 was subdivided into Lot No. 3011-A and Lot No. 3011-B, with Lot No. 3011-A registered in the name of spouses Jalbuna and Lot No. 3011-B in the name of Golez.\nOn June 5, 1975, spouses Jalbuna mortgaged Lot No. 3017-B to Philippine National Bank (PNB) as security for a loan. When they defaulted, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and sold Lot No. 3017-B at public auction, with PNB as the highest bidder. Title thereto was consolidated in the name of PNB and was issued TCT No. T-61465.\nThereafter, PNB sold the lot to spouses Johnny and Nona Lucero, who were issued TCT No. 76938. As the new owners of Lot No. 3017-B, they filed an ejectment case against Tranquilina, Azucena, Freddie and Eduardo, all surnamed Militar, the actual occupants therein.\nOn October 2, 1989, Tranquilina, Azucena, Freddie and Eduardo as surviving heirs of Teodorico and Deogracias Militar, filed a complaint against spouses Jalbuna, PNB, and spouses Lucero for Reconveyance of Title, Annulment of Sale, Cancellation of Titles and Damages. Other heirs of Deogracias on the side of Remedios filed a complaint-in-intervention to join the plaintiffs. They prayed for: 1) the declaration of nullity of the two (2) deeds of sale dated April 24, 1975 and April 25, 1975 covering Lot No. 3011 and Lot No. 3017-B, respectively; 2) the cancellation of title covering Lot No. 3017-B in the name of spouses Lucero; 3) the cancellation of title covering Lot No. 3011-A in the name of spouses Jalbuna; 4) the reconveyance of Lot 3011-A and Lot No. 3017-B to the heirs of Deogracias Militar; and 5) actual, exemplary and moral damages.\n[2]\nSpouses Jalbuna invoked prescription, non-inclusion of indispensable parties and lack of cause of action since their predecessor, Deogracias, no longer had interest over the properties having sold them to third parties.\nPNB claimed that it was a mortgaee in good faith and for value; that the title of spouses Jalbuna was free from all liens and encumbrances when they secured the loan; and that it conducted verification and inspection of the property before granting the loan.\nSpouses Lucero alleged that the complaint was commenced without the real party in interest; that the cause of action has prescribed; and that they were innocent purchasers in good faith and for value.\nThe trial court rendered a decision\n[3]\ndated October 18, 1995, dismissing the complaint, complaint-in-intevention, as well as the cross claim of PNB. It held that the case was not brought in the name of all indispensable parties and although the two (2) deeds of sale were void for being simulated or fictitious, their nullity cannot be invoked against PNB and spouses Lucero because they were buyers in good faith. It found that the action for reconveyance had prescribed as it was filed more than fourteen (14) years from the execution of the Deeds of Sale covering the disputed properties. An action for reconveyance prescribes after ten (10) years from the issuance of title, which operates as a constructive notice.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court. It held that ultimate issue is the propriety of reconveyance and not the shares of the respective heirs which is proper in a case for partition. Thus, a final determination of the case can be had despite non-inclusion of other heirs because their interests may be severed and proceeded with separately. Further, it held that PNB and spouses Lucero were not buyers in good faith; and that the action for reconveyance based on implied trust does not prescribe. The dispositive portion reads as follows:\nWHERERFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated October 18, 1995, of the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Sixth Judicial Region, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 18836, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Certificate of Title covering Lot 3011-A in the names of Spouses Jalbuna and the Certificate of Title covering Lot 3017-B in the names of Spouses Lucero-Ariete are hereby declared null and void. Spouses Jalbuna and Spouses Lucero-Ariete are directed to reconvey the subject properties to its original owners, namely Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, as the undivided property, of the aforestated co-owners.\nSO ORDERED.\n[4]\nHence, the instant consolidated petitions, the resolution of which hinges on three pivotal questions: 1) whether or not the case was brought by all indispensable parties; 2) whether or not petitioners PNB and spouses Lucero were mortgagee and purchasers in good faith, respectively; and 3) whether or not action for reconveyance has prescribed or is barred by laches.\nWe are not persuaded by PNB's claim that the case was not brought by all indispensable parties as other heirs of Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad have not been named as parties therein.\nAn indispensable party is one whose interest will be affected by the court's action in the litigation, and without whom no final determination of the case can be had. The party's interest in the subject matter of the suit and in the relief sought are so inextricably intertwined with the other parties' that his legal presence as a party to the proceeding is an absolute necessity. In his absence there cannot be a resolution of the dispute of the parties before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable.\n[5]\nConversely, a party is not indispensable to the suit if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is distinct and divisible from the interest of the other parties and will not necessarily be prejudiced by a judgment which does complete justice to the parties in court. He is not indispensable if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action or will simply avoid multiple litigation.\n[6]\nThere are two essential tests of an indispensable party: (1) can relief be afforded the plaintiff without the presence of the other party?; and, (2) can the case be decided on the merits without prejudicing the rights of the other party? There is, however, no fixed formula for determining who is an indispensable party; this can only be determined in the context and by the facts of the particular suit or litigation.\n[7]\nIn the case at bar, the ultimate relief sought by the action is the reconveyance of titles to their rightful owners. The records reveal that prior to the forgery, the disputed properties were registered in the names of the co-owners, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, whose interests remained undivided. Thus, if reconveyance of the titles is granted, the titles will revert back to the estates of the deceased co-owners and not to their individual heirs, whose interests are divisible and may properly be ventilated in another proceeding. Therefore, a co-heir may bring such action without necessarily joining all the other co-heirs as co-plaintiffs because the suit is deemed to be instituted for the benefit of all. As correctly held by the Court of Appeals:\nIt should be remembered, nevertheless, that the ultimate issue herein is the propriety of reconveyance and not the shares of the respective heirs of the co-owners, the latter being determined in a case for partition. An action for partition is the action where co-ownership is declared and the segregation and conveyance of a determinate portion of the property is made. The heirs of the co-owners, (Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad), if there are any, including the appellants herein may claim their respective shares in an action for partition. Any claim of interest, by way of succession, from the co-owners may be severed and proceeded with separately and a final determination in the action for recoveyance can be had despite the non-inclusion of other heirs because the interest of the respective heirs of the co-owners, may be severed. Corollary, the instant case, may proceed without the other heirs, if there are any, because they are mere necessary parties. Moreover, in a\nco-ownership, the act of one benefits all the co-owners\n, unless the former repudiates the co-ownership. Thus, if the appellants herein prevail in the case for reconveyance, it will also redound to the benefit of the other co-owners or co-heirs.\n[8]\nPNB next argues that since Deogracias sold his shares in the disputed lots, his heirs, herein respondents, do not have a cause of action against it, spouses Jalbuna and spouses Lucero.\nThis argument is proper had Deogracias died ahead of the other co-owners. However, records show that Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad predeceased Deogracias. Glicerio died on March 22, 1939, Tomas on August 20, 1959, Caridad on April 29, 1957, while Deogracias died on March 17, 1964.\nArticle 1003 of the Civil Code provides:\nArt. 1003. If there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse, the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased in accordance with the following articles.\nClearly, when Glicerio and Caridad died intestate and without issue, their shares in the disputed properties were inherited by Deogracias and Tomas. It is this portion that respondents, as heirs of Deogracias, have an interest on and which vested them with personality to institute the present case.\nPNB and spouses Lucero claim to be mortgagee and buyers in good faith, respectively, since title to Lot No. 3017-B appeared to be free from any encumbrance. They argue that a person dealing with a registered land may rely on the correctness of the certificate of title and is not required to go beyond it to determine the condition of the property.\nWhether",

    "facts": "",
    "issues": "petitioners are innocent mortgagee or purchasers in good faith and for value, is a factual matter, which cannot be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.\n[9]\nSettled is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally embark on a re-examination of the evidence adduced by the parties during trial.\n[10]\nIn\nHeirs of the Late Spouses Aurelio and Esperanza Balite v. Lim\n,\n[11]\nwe held that factual findings of the Court of Appeals are binding and conclusive upon us. These findings may be reviewed only under exceptional circumstances such as when the inference is manifestly mistaken; the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; findings of the trial court contradict those of the appellate court; or the latter manifestly overlooked relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court based on its findings of facts which are in accord with the documents on record. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals' finding that petitioners were not mortgagee or buyers in good faith.\nMoreover, the burden of proving the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value lies upon him who asserts that status.\n[12]\nIn discharging the burden, it is not enough to invoke the ordinary presumption of good faith.\n[13]\nThe rule is settled that a buyer of real property in possession of persons other than the seller must be wary and should investigate the rights of those in possession. Without such inquiry, the buyer can hardly be regarded as buyer in good faith and cannot have any right over the property.\n[14]\nPNB claims that it conducted the necessary inquiry and investigation on the subject lot and was convinced that Nilda Jalbuna, as one of the heirs of Estanislao Militar, had every right to mortgage the same, even if she was not in actual possession thereof.\nHowever, considering that the land was in the possession of persons other than the mortgagors, PNB should have inquired whether the possessors knew that the lot is being mortgaged, and the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the lot by the mortgagors. Indeed, while PNB is not expected to conduct an exhaustive investigation on the history of the mortgagor's title, it cannot be excused from the duty of exercising the due diligence required of a banking institution. In\nTomas v. Tomas\n,\n[15]\nwe noted that it is standard practice for banks, before approving a loan, to send representatives to the property offered as collateral to assess its actual condition and to investigate who are the real owners thereof. We held that banks are expected to exercise more care and prudence than private individuals in their dealings, even those involving registered lands, for their business is affected with public interest.

The complaint thus amounts to an action for declaration of nullity of a void contract, which does not prescribe.\nNeither could\nlaches\nbe successfully invoked.\nLaches\nis a doctrine in equity which has been aptly described as \"justice outside legality\", and applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law.\nAequetas nunguam contravenit legis\n.

  "clean_text": "[ G.R. NO. 164801, August 18, 2005 ]\nPHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ESTANISLAO MILITAR AND DEOGRACIAS MILITAR, REPRESENTED BY TRANQUILINA MILITAR, RESPONDENTS.\n[G.R. NO.165165]\nSPOUSES JOHNNY LUCERO AND NONA ARIETE, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF ESTANISLAO MILITAR, DEOGRACIAS MILITAR, AND TRANQUILINA MILITAR (DECEASED), NOW REPRESENTED BY AZUCENA MILITAR, FREDDIE MILITAR, EDUARDO MILITAR, ROMEO L. MILITAR, NELLY LY BOLANIO, LETICIA LY AND DELIA LY SI ASOYCO, RESPONDENTS.\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:\nThese consolidated petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure assail the June 4, 2004 decision\n[1]\nof the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 54831, which reversed the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 18836, and its August 4, 2004 resolution denying reconsideration thereof.\nThe facts are as follows:\nDeogracias, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, all surnamed Militar, were heirs of Estanislao Militar and the registered co-owners of Lot Nos. 3011 and 3017 covered by OCT No. T-8238-A (0-16879) and OCT No. 94-(0-16878).\nOn August 16, 1941, Deogracias sold his undivided share in Lot No. 3011 to Pedro Golez, and in Lot No. 3017 to spouses Sofronio and Lourdes Lumagbas. Golez annotated the sale at the back of the title thereof while spouses Lumagbas caused the subdivision of Lot No. 3017 into Lot No. 3017-A and Lot No. 3017-B, with Lot No. 3017-A registered in their names under TCT No. 8239.\nNotwithstanding the sale, Deogracias continued to occupy a portion of Lot No. 3011 and Lot No. 3017-B until his death on March 17, 1964. Glicerio died on March 22, 1939, Tomas on August 20, 1959 and Caridad on April 29, 1957. Glicerio and Caridad died without issue. Deogracias was survived by Teodorico and Remedios, while Tomas was survived by Wenceslao and Ladislao.\nHowever, in a Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 24, 1975, Deogracias, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad purportedly sold Lot No. 3011 to spouses Rodolfo and Nilda Jalbuna. In another Deed of Sale dated April 25, 1975, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad purportedly sold Lot No. 3017-B to the same spouses. Consequently, titles to Lot Nos. 3011 and 3017-B were cancelled and new titles, TCT Nos. 39083 and 39082, respectively, were issued to spouses Jalbuna.\nSubsequently, Lot No. 3011 was subdivided into Lot No. 3011-A and Lot No. 3011-B, with Lot No. 3011-A registered in the name of spouses Jalbuna and Lot No. 3011-B in the name of Golez.\nOn June 5, 1975, spouses Jalbuna mortgaged Lot No. 3017-B to Philippine National Bank (PNB) as security for a loan. When they defaulted, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and sold Lot No. 3017-B at public auction, with PNB as the highest bidder. Title thereto was consolidated in the name of PNB and was issued TCT No. T-61465.\nThereafter, PNB sold the lot to spouses Johnny and Nona Lucero, who were issued TCT No. 76938. As the new owners of Lot No. 3017-B, they filed an ejectment case against Tranquilina, Azucena, Freddie and Eduardo, all surnamed Militar, the actual occupants therein.\nOn October 2, 1989, Tranquilina, Azucena, Freddie and Eduardo as surviving heirs of Teodorico and Deogracias Militar, filed a complaint against spouses Jalbuna, PNB, and spouses Lucero for Reconveyance of Title, Annulment of Sale, Cancellation of Titles and Damages. Other heirs of Deogracias on the side of Remedios filed a complaint-in-intervention to join the plaintiffs. They prayed for: 1) the declaration of nullity of the two (2) deeds of sale dated April 24, 1975 and April 25, 1975 covering Lot No. 3011 and Lot No. 3017-B, respectively; 2) the cancellation of title covering Lot No. 3017-B in the name of spouses Lucero; 3) the cancellation of title covering Lot No. 3011-A in the name of spouses Jalbuna; 4) the reconveyance of Lot 3011-A and Lot No. 3017-B to the heirs of Deogracias Militar; and 5) actual, exemplary and moral damages.\n[2]\nSpouses Jalbuna invoked prescription, non-inclusion of indispensable parties and lack of cause of action since their predecessor, Deogracias, no longer had interest over the properties having sold them to third parties.\nPNB claimed that it was a mortgaee in good faith and for value; that the title of spouses Jalbuna was free from all liens and encumbrances when they secured the loan; and that it conducted verification and inspection of the property before granting the loan.\nSpouses Lucero alleged that the complaint was commenced without the real party in interest; that the cause of action has prescribed; and that they were innocent purchasers in good faith and for value.\nThe trial court rendered a decision\n[3]\ndated October 18, 1995, dismissing the complaint, complaint-in-intevention, as well as the cross claim of PNB. It held that the case was not brought in the name of all indispensable parties and although the two (2) deeds of sale were void for being simulated or fictitious, their nullity cannot be invoked against PNB and spouses Lucero because they were buyers in good faith. It found that the action for reconveyance had prescribed as it was filed more than fourteen (14) years from the execution of the Deeds of Sale covering the disputed properties. An action for reconveyance prescribes after ten (10) years from the issuance of title, which operates as a constructive notice.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court. It held that ultimate issue is the propriety of reconveyance and not the shares of the respective heirs which is proper in a case for partition. Thus, a final determination of the case can be had despite non-inclusion of other heirs because their interests may be severed and proceeded with separately. Further, it held that PNB and spouses Lucero were not buyers in good faith; and that the action for reconveyance based on implied trust does not prescribe. The dispositive portion reads as follows:\nWHERERFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated October 18, 1995, of the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Sixth Judicial Region, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 18836, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Certificate of Title covering Lot 3011-A in the names of Spouses Jalbuna and the Certificate of Title covering Lot 3017-B in the names of Spouses Lucero-Ariete are hereby declared null and void. Spouses Jalbuna and Spouses Lucero-Ariete are directed to reconvey the subject properties to its original owners, namely Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, as the undivided property, of the aforestated co-owners.\nSO ORDERED.\n[4]\nHence, the instant consolidated petitions, the resolution of which hinges on three pivotal questions: 1) whether or not the case was brought by all indispensable parties; 2) whether or not petitioners PNB and spouses Lucero were mortgagee and purchasers in good faith, respectively; and 3) whether or not action for reconveyance has prescribed or is barred by laches.\nWe are not persuaded by PNB's claim that the case was not brought by all indispensable parties as other heirs of Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad have not been named as parties therein.\nAn indispensable party is one whose interest will be affected by the court's action in the litigation, and without whom no final determination of the case can be had. The party's interest in the subject matter of the suit and in the relief sought are so inextricably intertwined with the other parties' that his legal presence as a party to the proceeding is an absolute necessity. In his absence there cannot be a resolution of the dispute of the parties before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable.\n[5]\nConversely, a party is not indispensable to the suit if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is distinct and divisible from the interest of the other parties and will not necessarily be prejudiced by a judgment which does complete justice to the parties in court. He is not indispensable if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action or will simply avoid multiple litigation.\n[6]\nThere are two essential tests of an indispensable party: (1) can relief be afforded the plaintiff without the presence of the other party?; and, (2) can the case be decided on the merits without prejudicing the rights of the other party? There is, however, no fixed formula for determining who is an indispensable party; this can only be determined in the context and by the facts of the particular suit or litigation.\n[7]\nIn the case at bar, the ultimate relief sought by the action is the reconveyance of titles to their rightful owners. The records reveal that prior to the forgery, the disputed properties were registered in the names of the co-owners, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, whose interests remained undivided. Thus, if reconveyance of the titles is granted, the titles will revert back to the estates of the deceased co-owners and not to their individual heirs, whose interests are divisible and may properly be ventilated in another proceeding. Therefore, a co-heir may bring such action without necessarily joining all the other co-heirs as co-plaintiffs because the suit is deemed to be instituted for the benefit of all. As correctly held by the Court of Appeals:\nIt should be remembered, nevertheless, that the ultimate issue herein is the propriety of reconveyance and not the shares of the respective heirs of the co-owners, the latter being determined in a case for partition. An action for partition is the action where co-ownership is declared and the segregation and conveyance of a determinate portion of the property is made. The heirs of the co-owners, (Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad), if there are any, including the appellants herein may claim their respective shares in an action for partition. Any claim of interest, by way of succession, from the co-owners may be severed and proceeded with separately and a final determination in the action for recoveyance can be had despite the non-inclusion of other heirs because the interest of the respective heirs of the co-owners, may be severed. Corollary, the instant case, may proceed without the other heirs, if there are any, because they are mere necessary parties. Moreover, in a\nco-ownership, the act of one benefits all the co-owners\n, unless the former repudiates the co-ownership. Thus, if the appellants herein prevail in the case for reconveyance, it will also redound to the benefit of the other co-owners or co-heirs.\n[8]\nPNB next argues that since Deogracias sold his shares in the disputed lots, his heirs, herein respondents, do not have a cause of action against it, spouses Jalbuna and spouses Lucero.\nThis argument is proper had Deogracias died ahead of the other co-owners. However, records show that Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad predeceased Deogracias. Glicerio died on March 22, 1939, Tomas on August 20, 1959, Caridad on April 29, 1957, while Deogracias died on March 17, 1964.\nArticle 1003 of the Civil Code provides:\nArt. 1003. If there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse, the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased in accordance with the following articles.\nClearly, when Glicerio and Caridad died intestate and without issue, their shares in the disputed properties were inherited by Deogracias and Tomas. It is this portion that respondents, as heirs of Deogracias, have an interest on and which vested them with personality to institute the present case.\nPNB and spouses Lucero claim to be mortgagee and buyers in good faith, respectively, since title to Lot No. 3017-B appeared to be free from any encumbrance. They argue that a person dealing with a registered land may rely on the correctness of the certificate of title and is not required to go beyond it to determine the condition of the property.\nWhether petitioners are innocent mortgagee or purchasers in good faith and for value, is a factual matter, which cannot be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.\n[9]\nSettled is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally embark on a re-examination of the evidence adduced by the parties during trial.\n[10]\nIn\nHeirs of the Late Spouses Aurelio and Esperanza Balite v. Lim\n,\n[11]\nwe held that factual findings of the Court of Appeals are binding and conclusive upon us. These findings may be reviewed only under exceptional circumstances such as when the inference is manifestly mistaken; the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; findings of the trial court contradict those of the appellate court; or the latter manifestly overlooked relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court based on its findings of facts which are in accord with the documents on record. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals' finding that petitioners were not mortgagee or buyers in good faith.\nMoreover, the burden of proving the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value lies upon him who asserts that status.\n[12]\nIn discharging the burden, it is not enough to invoke the ordinary presumption of good faith.\n[13]\nThe rule is settled that a buyer of real property in possession of persons other than the seller must be wary and should investigate the rights of those in possession. Without such inquiry, the buyer can hardly be regarded as buyer in good faith and cannot have any right over the property.\n[14]\nPNB claims that it conducted the necessary inquiry and investigation on the subject lot and was convinced that Nilda Jalbuna, as one of the heirs of Estanislao Militar, had every right to mortgage the same, even if she was not in actual possession thereof.\nHowever, considering that the land was in the possession of persons other than the mortgagors, PNB should have inquired whether the possessors knew that the lot is being mortgaged, and the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the lot by the mortgagors. Indeed, while PNB is not expected to conduct an exhaustive investigation on the history of the mortgagor's title, it cannot be excused from the duty of exercising the due diligence required of a banking institution. In\nTomas v. Tomas\n,\n[15]\nwe noted that it is standard practice for banks, before approving a loan, to send representatives to the property offered as collateral to assess its actual condition and to investigate who are the real owners thereof. We held that banks are expected to exercise more care and prudence than private individuals in their dealings, even those involving registered lands, for their business is affected with public interest. Verily, PNB was remiss in the exercise of due diligence required of a banking institution, hence it cannot be considered as mortgagee in good faith.\nNeither could spouses Lucero be considered buyers in good faith. As respondents' neighbors, they could have verified the status of the property they were buying by inquiring from the possessors thereof. This, they failed to do; hence they cannot be considered buyers in good faith.\nAs to whether the action for reconveyance has prescribed, we held in\nSantos v. Santos\n,\n[16]\nciting\nLacsamana v. CA\n,\n[17]\nthat the right to file an action for reconveyance on the ground that the certificate of title was obtained by means of a fictitious deed of sale is virtually an action for the declaration of its nullity, which does not prescribe.\nIn the case at bar, the complaint filed was for the reconveyance of the properties in question to the estates of Deogracias, Glicerio, Tomas and Caridad, considering that the deeds of sale were simulated and fictitious. The complaint thus amounts to an action for declaration of nullity of a void contract, which does not prescribe.\nNeither could\nlaches\nbe successfully invoked.\nLaches\nis a doctrine in equity which has been aptly described as \"justice outside legality\", and applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law.\nAequetas nunguam contravenit legis\n. The positive mandate of Art. 1410 of the Civil Code conferring imprescriptibility to actions or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract should pre-empt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity. Certainly,\nlaches\ncannot be set up to resist the enforcement of an imprescriptible legal right; thus, respondents can validly vindicate their inheritance despite the lapse of time.\n[18]\nFinally, while certificates of title are indefeasible, unassailable and binding against the whole world, they merely confirm or record title already existing and vested. They cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner, nor can they be used for the perpetration of fraud; neither do they permit one to enrich himself at the expense of others.\n[19]\n, the petitions are\nDENIED.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 4, 2004 in CA-G.R. CV No. 54831 and its resolution dated August 4, 2004, are hereby\nAFFIRMED in toto.\nSO ORDERED.\nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Quisumbing, Carpio\n, and\nAzcuna, JJ.\n, concur.\n[1]\nRollo in G.R.

Respondent Judge Beldia apparently granted bail to Santos and approved the corresponding bail bond without serving notice to the prosecutor.\nConsequently, Ruiz filed the instant administrative complaint contending that respondent Judge Beldia had no authority to grant bail to Santos since the Investigating Prosecutor has yet to conclude the preliminary investigation. She claimed that for as long as the information has not yet been filed in court, a court has no power to grant bail to a detained person since it has not yet acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused.\nIn his Comment\n[7]\ndated August 14, 2000, respondent Judge Beldia maintained that Section 1 (c), Rule 114 of the Rules of Court allows any person in custody, even if not formally charged in court, to apply for bail.\nMeanwhile, the OCA directed the Clerk of Court, Branch 272, RTC-Marikina City, Atty. Elvira Badillo-Adarlo, to confirm whether a formal petition for admission to bail was filed by Santos or her counsel and, whether Executive Judge Reuben P. de la Cruz and Presiding Judge Olga P. Enriquez were absent or unavailable on May 30, 2000 when the release order was issued.\n[8]\nOn June 18, 2002, Atty. Badillo-Adarlo informed the OCA that the records of release orders and bailbonds in her custody did not include the subject release order issued by respondent Judge Beldia. As such, she could not tell whether a formal petition for admission to bail was filed by Santos. She likewise confirmed that Executive Judge De la Cruz and Presiding Judge Enriquez were present and available on the day that Judge Beldia issued the release order.\n[9]\nOn November 20, 2002, the complaint was re-docketed as a regular administrative matter. At the same time, the parties were required to manifest whether they are willing to submit the case for resolution based on the pleadings filed.\n[10]\nThe parties failed to file their manifestations, hence the filing thereof was deemed waived.\nIn its report\n[11]\ndated July 31, 2002, the OCA recommended that respondent Judge Beldia be held liable for gross ignorance of the law and fined in the amount of P5,000.00. It opined that although a person in custody and who is not formally charged in court could apply for bail pursuant to Section 17 (c), Rule 114, the grant thereof by Judge Beldia was nonetheless irregular. It noted that no formal petition or application for bail was filed by Santos, and even if one was filed, the Marikina courts could not have properly taken cognizance of the same since Santos was detained at Camp Crame in Quezon City. There was also no showing that the regular judge of Branch 272, RTC-Marikina City, was unavailable to act on the application for bail.\nWe agree with the recommendation of the OCA.\nRecord shows that Executive Judge De la Cruz and Presiding Judge Enriquez were present on May 30, 2000 to act on the bail application of Santos. When respondent Judge Beldia acted on the bail application of Santos on May 30, 2000, his designation was merely an “assisting judge” in the RTC-Marikina City, his permanent station being in Branch 57, RTC-San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. As such, his authority in the Marikina court is limited and he could only act on an application for bail filed therewith in the absence or unavailability of the regular judge.\nConcededly, a person lawfully arrested and detained but who has not yet been formally charged in court, can seek his provisional release through the filing of an application for bail. He need not wait for a formal complaint or information to be filed since bail is available to “all persons”    where the offense is bailable.\n[12]\nSection 7, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a judge could grant bail to a person lawfully arrested but without a warrant, upon waiver of his right under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as Santos    had done upon her inquest.\nUndeniably too, Santos was entitled to bail as a matter of right since the offense with which she was charged does not carry the penalty of life imprisonment,\nreclusion perpetua\nor death.\n[13]\nNotwithstanding, it was incumbent upon respondent Judge Beldia to grant bail to Santos in accordance with established rules and procedure. Respondent Judge Beldia    failed in this respect and must thus be held administratively liable.\nSection 17, par. (c) of Rule 114 distinctly states:\nSEC. 17. Bail, where filed. – …\n(c) Any person in custody who is not yet charged in court may apply for bail with\nany court in the province, city, or municipality where he is held.\n(Emphasis supplied)\nThe Certificate of Detention\n[14]\nissued by the PNP-TMG-SOD shows that Santos was detained at Camp Crame in Quezon City. Thus, as correctly pointed out by the OCA, the application for bail should have been filed before the proper Quezon City court and not in Marikina City.\nIn addition, it appears that no formal application or petition for the grant of bail was filed before the RTC-Marikina City. There were no records of the application or the release order issued by respondent Judge Beldia. Neither was there a hearing conducted thereon nor the prosecutor notified of the bail application.\nUnder the present rules, a hearing on an application for bail is mandatory.\n[15]\nIn\nCortes v. Judge Catral\n,\n[16]\nwe ruled that in all cases, whether bail is a matter of right or of discretion, reasonable notice of hearing must be given to the prosecutor, or at least his recommendation on the matter must be sought. The rationale for this was explained in this wise:\nBail should be fixed according to the circumstances of each case. The amount fixed should be sufficient to ensure the presence of the accused at the trial yet reasonable enough to comply with the constitutional provision that bail should not be excessive. Therefore, whether bail is a matter of right or of discretion, reasonable notice of hearing is required to be given to the prosecutor or fiscal or at least he must be asked for his recommendation because in fixing the amount of bail, the judge is required to take into account a number of factors such as the applicant’s character and reputation, forfeiture of other bonds or whether he is a fugitive from justice.\n[17]\nJudge Beldia disregarded basic procedural rules when he granted bail to Santos\nsans\nhearing and notice and without the latter having filed a formal petition for bail. \nDavide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Quisumbing, Carpio\n, and\nAzcuna, JJ\n., concur.\n[1]\nRollo, pp. 3-4.\n[2]\nPresidential Decree No. 1612, March 2, 1979.\n[3]\nArt. 125.\nDelay in the delivery of detained persons to the proper judicial authorities\n. – The penalties provided in the next preceding article shall be imposed upon the public officer or employee who shall detain any person for some legal ground and shall fail to deliver such person to the proper judicial authorities within the period of: twelve (12) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by light penalties, or their equivalent; eighteen (18) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by correctional penalties, or their equivalent; and thirty-six (36) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by afflictive or capital penalties, or their equivalent.\nIn every case, the person detained shall be informed of the cause of his detention and shall be allowed, upon his request, to communicate and confer at any time with his attorney or counsel.\n[4]\nSEC. 7.\nWhen accused lawfully arrested without warrant\n. – When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant for an offense cognizable by the Regional Trial Court the complaint or information may be filed by the offended party, peace officer or fiscal without a preliminary investigation having been first conducted, on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting officer or person.\nHowever, before the filing of such complaint or information, the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation by a proper officer in accordance with this Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, with the assistance of a lawyer, and in case of non-availability of a lawyer, a responsible person of his choice. Notwithstanding such waiver, he may apply for bail as provided in the corresponding rule and the investigation must be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its inception.\nIf the case has been filed in court without a preliminary investigation having been first conducted, the accused may within five (5) days from the time he learns of the filing of the information, ask for a preliminary investigation with the same right to adduce evidence in his favor in the manner prescribed in this Rule.\n[5]\nSupra\n, note 1 at 5-6.\n[6]\nId.\nat 7.\n[7]\nId.\nat 18-19.\n[8]\nId.\nat 36.\n[9]\nId.\nat 34.\n[10]\nId.\nat 44.\n[11]\nId.\nat 40-43.\n[12]\nPaderanga v.

BELDIA, JR., REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 57, SAN CARLOS CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, [ASSISTING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 272, MARIKINA CITY,] RESPONDENT.\nYNARES-SANTIAGO, J:\nIn an Affidavit-Complaint\n[1]\nfiled with the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), complainant Shirley C. Ruiz charged respondent Judge Rolindo D. Beldia, Jr. of Branch 57, Regional Trial Court, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental, with gross ignorance of the law and grave abuse of authority in connection with the grant of bail and issuance of a release order in favor of one Lourdes Estrella Santos.\nRuiz is the private complainant in I.S. No. 2000-1031 for violation of the Anti-Fencing Law\n[2]\npending before the Department of Justice (DOJ). Santos, who was arrested during entrapment operations relative to the carnapping of Ruiz’s vehicle, was one of    the respondents therein.\nAfter her arrest on May 24, 2000, Santos was detained in Camp Crame, Quezon City, pending the filing of formal charges in court. Upon inquest, she executed a waiver of the provisions of Article 125\n[3]\nof the Revised Penal Code in relation to Rule 112, Section 7\n[4]\nof the then applicable 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.
