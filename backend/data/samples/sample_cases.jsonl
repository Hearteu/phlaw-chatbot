NO. 160391, August 09, 2005 ]\nDUSIT HOTEL NIKKO AND PHILIPPINE HOTELIERS, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL UNION OF WORKERS IN HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES (NUWHRAIN) - DUSIT HOTEL NIKKO CHAPTER AND ROWENA AGONCILLO, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N CALLEJO, SR., J.:\nBefore us is a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision\n[1]\nof the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 72006 which affirmed the Decision\n[2]\nof the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR CA No. 014111-97 finding Dusit Hotel Nikko (Hotel) and Philippine Hoteliers, Inc. (PHI) of illegally terminating the employment services of respondent Rowena Agoncillo.\nThe Case for Rowena Agoncillo The PHI owned and operated the Dusit Hotel Nikko. Since March 1, 1984, Rowena Agoncillo was employed by the Hotel. After some time, she was promoted as Supervisor of Outlet Cashiers and later promoted as Senior Front Office Cashier, with a monthly salary of P14,600.00, inclusive of service charge.\n[3]\nIn January 1995, the Hotel decided to trim down the number of its employees from the original count of 820 to 750.\n[4]\nOn February 21, 1996, the Hotel, through an Inter-Office Memorandum signed by the general manager of Dusit, Yoshikazu Masuda, offered a Special Early Retirement Program (SERP) to all its employees. It was stated therein that the program was intended to \"provide employees financial benefits prior to prolonged renovation period and, at the same time, to enable management to streamline the organization by eliminating redundant positions and having a more efficient and productive manpower complement.\"\n[5]\nIn a Letter dated February 26, 1996 addressed to the Hotel, the National Union of Workers in Hotel, Restaurant and Allied Industries, Hotel Nikko Manila Garden Chapter (Union), through its president, Mr. Reynaldo Rasing, sought \"a commitment from the management that the employees terminated due to redundancy will not be replaced by new employees; nor will their positions be given to subcontractors, agencies or casual employees.\"\nThe Union received a Letter dated March 30, 1996 from Masuda confirming his earlier decision to separate 243 employees from the Hotel's services anchored on redundancy and that the separation of the said employees will take effect on April 30, 1996.\n[6]\nConsequently, a total of 243 employees, including Agoncillo, 161 of whom were Union officers and members, were separated from the Hotel's employment. As a result, the membership of the Union was substantially reduced.\nOn April 1, 1996, the Hotel wrote Regional Director Romeo Young of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), National Capital Region, informing him that the Hotel terminated the employment of 243 employees due to redundancy. On the same day, Agoncillo was summoned by Hotel Comptroller Reynaldo Casacop, who gave her a letter of even date informing the latter of her \"separation from service due to redundancy effective close of office hours of April 30, 1996.\"\n[7]\nCasacop advised Agoncillo to just avail of the Hotel's SERP, as embodied in the inter-office memorandum of Masuda.\n[8]\nHe informed her that she had the option to avail of the program and that, in the meantime, he will defer the processing of her termination papers to give her time to decide. On April 3, 1996, Agoncillo finally told Casacop that she would not avail of the SERP benefits. By then, she had decided to file a complaint for illegal dismissal against the Hotel.\nMeanwhile, the Hotel temporarily closed operations because of the renovation thereof.\nWhen news spread among the hotel employees that Agoncillo would contest her termination before the NLRC, she was summoned by Personnel Manager Leticia Delarmente to a conference. The two met on May 21, 1996 in the presence of Willy Dizon, who later became the Director for Personnel and Training of the Hotel. At the said meeting, Delarmente and Dizon repeatedly asked Agoncillo to give back the original copy of the April 1, 1996 termination letter. Agoncillo told them that the letter was already in the possession of her counsel. Agoncillo was relieved when she was given another letter of even date stating that, by reason of her non-availment of the SERP, she was still considered an employee but on temporary lay-off due to the ongoing renovation of the Hotel\n[9]\nand that she will just be advised accordingly of her work schedule when the Hotel reopens.\n[10]\nBut her relief was shortlived. Delarmente and Dizon offered to reinstate Agoncillo but not to her former position as Senior Front Office Cashier. Agoncillo objected but informed them that she could accept the position of Reservation Clerk.\n[11]\nHowever, no response was received.\nMeanwhile, the Hotel hired six (6) Front Office Cashiers on October 1, 1996.\n[12]\nOn October 21, 1996, Agoncillo received a telegram from the Human Resources Department of the Hotel directing her to report to Dizon as soon as possible.\n[13]\nShe was told by Dizon that the Hotel was willing to reinstate her but as an Outlet Cashier. Dizon explained that the Hotel had already hired new employees for the positions of Reservation Clerks. Agoncillo, however, pointed out that she was already an Outlet Cashier Supervisor before her promotion as Senior Front Office Cashier and that if she accepted the position, it would be an unjustified demotion on her part. Dizon, however, explained that the management wanted \"new graduates\" as \"front liners,\"\ni.e.\n, new graduates who would occupy the front desks and other sections exposed to guests. On the other hand, Agoncillo reiterated that she could accept the lower position of Reservation Clerk, but Dizon rejected the suggestion. Dizon countered that Agoncillo could be reinstated as a Room Service Cashier \"\npara nakatago\n.\" At this point, Agoncillo was irked by the comments of Dizon and asked, \"\nBakit Sir, nakakaperhuwisyo ba ang physical appearance ko?\n\" As to which Dizon replied, \"\nKasi ikaw, nagpabaya ka sa katawan mo\n.\" The conversation between them transpired in the presence and within hearing distance of other hotel employees, including Reynaldo Rasing, the president of the Union.\n[14]\nAfter Agoncillo's meeting with Dizon on October 22, 1996, the latter kept on promising to find a suitable position for her. In those meetings, Dizon always offered reinstatement to positions that do not require guest exposure like Linen Dispatcher at the hotel basement or Secretary of Roomskeeping. When Agoncillo refused, Dizon just instructed her to return. Agoncillo had no specific position or assigned task to perform.\nOn November 1, 1996, the Hotel resumed operations. On November 11, 1996, the Union filed a Notice of Strike for unfair labor practice with the DOLE.\n[15]\nOn November 12, 1996, Agoncillo with the assistance of the Union, filed a Complaint against the PHI and Dusit Hotel Nikko for illegal dismissal before the NLRC.\nMeantime, the Secretary of Labor and Employment (SOLE) assumed jurisdiction over the dispute on November 29, 1996 after the requisite strike-vote was conducted.\n[16]\nThe case was docketed as NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96.\nOn January 5, 1997, the Hotel published an advertisement in the newspaper Manila Bulletin inviting prospective applicants as guest relations agents, bell service agents/valet parkers, housekeeping agents, and sales executives. The Hotel hired 135 additional employees, mostly on probationary and contractual bases. These new workers performed tasks according to the reclassified positions under the new Job Code, in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the Hotel and the Union.\n[17]\nA total of 215 workers replaced the previously dismissed employees, including Agoncillo.\nThe Case for the Hotel The petitioner Hotel, formerly known as Hotel Nikko Manila Garden, was owned and managed by the PHI, a corporation substantially owned by Japan Airlines (JAL). In November 1995, JAL formally turned over its majority shareholdings in PHI to a Thai corporation, Dusit Thani Public Co., Ltd. (Dusit). This gave Dusit the managerial control over the Hotel, which was then renamed Dusit Hotel Nikko.\n[18]\nWith the very stiff competition in the hotel industry in mind, Dusit has set a twofold objective, namely: (1) the total renovation of the Hotel, where it had earmarked the amount of about P300,000,000.00; and (2) a complete reorganization of the Hotel's manpower complement. The renovation of the Hotel, which called for its closure, began on May 1, 1996 and ended six months thereafter. On the other hand, the reorganization was done to standardize the Hotel's organizational set-up with all Dusit Hotels around the world and train the employees for their eventual deployment to its other chain of hotels. The reorganization program started with a staff reduction program wherein employees were given the chance to voluntarily avail of the SERP. As per its guidelines, the SERP is a one-time program offered by the Hotel to its regular employees who had at least one year of service as of April 30, 1996, in order to achieve the following:\na.)\nrealize optimum operational productivity and efficiency through a reorganization that will eliminate redundant position; b.)\nreduce expenses of the company; and c.)\nprovide employees the opportunity to receive lump-sum benefits for their immediate use before the 6-month closure.\n[19]\nPursuant to the reorganization program, a reclassification of positions ensued upon resumption of the Hotel's operation. Consequently, the position of Agoncillo as Senior Front Office Cashier was abolished and a new position of Guest Services Agent absorbing its functions was created. Considering that the new position requires skills in both reception and cashiering operations, respondent Hotel deemed it necessary to transfer Agoncillo to another position as Outlet Cashier, which does not require other skills aside from cashiering.\n[20]\nThe transfer of Agoncillo from Senior Front Office Cashier to Outlet Cashier does not entail any diminution of salary or rank. Despite which, she vehemently refused the transfer and insisted that she be reinstated to her former position. Since Agoncillo was not amenable to the said transfer, she did not assume her new position and since then had stopped reporting for work despite the Hotel's patient reminder to act on the contrary. Instead, she filed a complaint to question the prerogative of the management to validly transfer her to another position as she considers the transfer an act of constructive dismissal amounting to illegal termination and unfair labor practice in the form of union busting.\n[21]\nProceedings before the Labor Arbiter, NLRC and the CA On September 18, 1997, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment dismissing the complaint for unfair labor practice and constructive dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled that the reassignment of the complainant was done by management in the valid exercise of management prerogative, and that management has not dismissed her in any way.\n[22]\nOn October 27, 1997, the complainant appealed the decision to the NLRC.\nIn the meantime, on January 6, 1998, the SOLE issued an Order in NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96 in favor of the Union. The fallo of the Order reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:\nDeclaring the termination of 243 employees, including 161 Union officers and members on April 1, 1996, illegal; Ordering the immediate reinstatement of the 243 employees, without loss of seniority rights and with full backwages and benefits from the time of their termination until actual reinstatement, less the amounts received by them on account of the Company's Special Early Retirement Program; Declaring the Company guilty of unfair labor practice for:\nimplementing an illegal redundancy program in the guise of a Special Early Retirement Program, terminating in the process 243 employees, including 161 Union officers and members; implementing a New Job and Wage Classification and Manning Standards, in violation of Article 1, Section VII of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement; and violation of the CBA provisions on entry rates of new employees and rice subsidy for retained employees who were on duty during the renovation of the Hotel.\nOrdering the Company to cease and desist from further continuing with its commission of the unfair labor practice acts herein complained of.\nSO ORDERED.\n[23]\nThe respondents therein filed a motion for the reconsideration of the order but the SOLE denied the same. On March 10, 2000, the Union and the Hotel executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in which the Hotel agreed to pay P15,000.00 to each member of the Union by way of amicable settlement of NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96 in addition to the redundancy pay earlier paid to them and that they shall file with the DOLE a motion praying for the following:\na.\nDismissal of the case with prejudice in regard to:\n(i)\nillegal redundancy as to those who have received the settlement pay above and signed the Special Power of Attorney and Release, Waiver and Quitclaim; (ii)\nall ULP charges; and b.\nDismissal of the case without prejudice as to those who have not yet received the settlement pay.\n[24]\nHowever, the MOA was not submitted to the NLRC for its approval. Neither did Agoncillo receive any monetary benefits based on the MOA.\nAfter due proceedings, the NLRC rendered judgment on January 30, 2002, reversing the appealed decision of the Labor Arbiter, dated September 18, 1997. The fallo of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the appealed decision is SET ASIDE. Judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondent to:\nimmediately reinstate complainant to her former or equivalent position without loss of seniority rights and benefits; and to pay complainant full backwages computed from the time it was illegally withheld from her as a result of her illegal dismissal up to the time she is actually reinstated.\nSO ORDERED.\n[25]\nThe NLRC ruled that Agoncillo was illegally dismissed. It relied principally on the evidence of the complainant and the Order of the SOLE dated January 6, 1998. The respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, [26]\nwhich the NLRC denied. Hence, they filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari with Very Urgent Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction, [27]\nwhich is anchored on the following grounds, to wit:\nI WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT AGONCILLO WAS ILLEGALLY DISMISSSED CONSIDERING THAT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, PRIVATE RESPONDENT AGONCILLO WAS NEVER DISMISSED, CONSTRUCTIVELY OR OTHERWISE; II CONTRARY TO THE RULING OF THE HONORABLE COMMISSION, PRIVATE RESPONDENT AGONCILLO'S TRANSFER FROM THE POSITION OF SENIOR FRONT OFFICE CASHIER TO THE POSITION OF OUTLET CASHIER WAS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE; III EVEN ASSUMING IN GRATIA ARGUMENTI THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT AGONCILLO WAS INDEED SEPARATED FROM THE HOTEL, HER SEPARATION DUE TO REDUNDANCY WAS VALID AND/OR LEGAL. CONTRARY TO THE RULING OF THE HONORABLE COMMISSION, THE REDUNDANCY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED BY THE HOTEL IS VALID. FURTHERMORE, PRIVATE RESPONDENTS ARE BOUND BY THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE HOTEL WHICH, AMONG OTHERS, RECOGNIZES THE VALIDITY OF THE SAID PROGRAM; IV CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING, THE PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE. PRIVATE RESPONDENT AGONCILLO, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS NOT ENTITLED TO REINSTATEMENT WITH FULL BACKWAGES.\n[28]\nOn June 26, 2003, the CA rendered judgment dismissing the petition on the ground that no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the respondents therein.\nThe petitioners' motion for reconsideration\n[29]\nwas denied by the CA. They forthwith filed their petition for review alleging that:\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RENDERING THE ASSAILED DECISION AND RESOLUTION, HAVING DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT, CONSIDERING THAT -\nI THE NLRC GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT AGONCILLO WAS ILLEGALLY DISMISSED BECAUSE, IN THE FIRST PLACE, SHE WAS NEVER DISMISSED, CONSTRUCTIVELY OR OTHERWISE.\nII RESPONDENT AGONCILLO'S TRANSFER FROM THE POSITION OF SENIOR FRONT OFFICE CASHIER TO THE POSITION OF OUTLET CASHIER WAS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE.\nIII EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT RESPONDENT AGONCILLO WAS INDEED SEPARATED FROM THE HOTEL, HER SEPARATION DUE TO A REDUNDANCY PROGRAM WAS LEGAL. THE REDUNDANCY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED BY THE HOTEL IS LIKEWISE VALID. FURTHERMORE, RESPONDENTS ARE BOUND BY THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE HOTEL WHICH, AMONG OTHERS, RECOGNIZES THE VALIDITY OF THE SAID PROGRAM.\nIV IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, THE PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF ILLEGAL DISMISSAL, MUCH LESS UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE. HENCE, RESPONDENT AGONCILLO CANNOT BE ENTITLED TO REINSTATEMENT NOR TO FULL BACKWAGES.\n[30]\nThe Court's Ruling The petition is unmeritorious.\nThe issues for resolution are factual and Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari\n. The raison d'etre is that the Court is not a trier of facts. It is not to reexamine and reevaluate the evidence on record. Moreover, the factual findings of the NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, are accorded high respect and finality unless the factual findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter clash with those of the NLRC and the CA in which case, the Court will have to review the records and the arguments of the parties to resolve the factual issues and render substantial justice to the parties.\n[31]\nThe petitioners reiterate their submission that respondent Agoncillo had never been dismissed; she was merely transferred to another position, that of Outlet Cashier. She had been temporarily laid off because of the renovation of the hotel but she remained as an employee of the hotel. Following the completion of the renovation of the hotel, she was offered the position of outlet cashier; but she already filed her complaint before the Hotel was able to determine what position she could occupy which was mutually acceptable. The petitioners aver that the transfer of the respondent to the position of Outlet Cashier was a valid exercise of management prerogative based on its assessment of her qualification, aptitude and competence, absent any showing to be contrary to law, morals or public policy, unreasonable, inconvenient and prejudicial to the employee. The petitioners insist that the transfer of Agoncillo was pursuant to its objective of completely reorganizing its manpower component. It did not entail any diminution in salary, benefits, privileges or job level. The petitioners also maintain that even if the respondent was separated from the Hotel, it was justified to do so due to redundancy. The validity of the said program was even recognized by the respondents in the MOA executed by petitioner Hotel and the respondent Union. The petitioners maintain that the respondents are bound by the MOA.\nThe contentions are untenable. It is plain as day that the petitioners terminated the employment of respondent Agoncillo effective April 30, 1996, as evidenced by their letter which reads:\nApril 1, 1996 Ms. Rowena Agoncillo Parañaque, Metro Manila Dear Ms. Agoncillo:\nWe have recently conducted a study of the Hotel's organizational structure and found the need to reorganize the same and eliminate many positions that have become redundant.\nAs a result of such study, it was determined that your position as Senior Front Office Cashier is redundant. In this connection, please be advised of your separation from service due to redundancy, effective close of office hours of April 30, 1996. You will receive not later than April 30, 1996 the separation pay provided for under the law, plus the amount of P19,000.00.\nWe take this opportunity to thank you for your service to Hotel Nikko Manila Garden and extend to you our best wishes for your next endeavors.\nVery truly yours, (Sgd.)\nPEARL V. ARAGON Director for Administration\n[32]\nThe letter of the petitioners terminating the employment of Agoncillo on the ground of redundancy was rejected by the Order of the SOLE in NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96 where he ruled that the petitioners' redundancy program was but a ploy, a contrivance cunningly scripted by them to subvert the Union and unlawfully dismiss many of its employees. The SOLE declared that, by their acts, the petitioners were guilty of unfair labor practice.\nRedundancy exists when the service capability of the workforce is in excess of what is reasonably needed to meet the demands of the business enterprise. A reasonably redundant position is one rendered superfluous by any number of factors, such as overhiring of workers, decreased volume of business, dropping of a particular product line previously manufactured by the company or phasing out of service activity priorly undertaken by the business. Among the requisites of a valid redundancy program are: (1) the good faith of the employer in abolishing the redundant position; and (2) fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining what positions are to be declared redundant and accordingly abolished.\n[33]\nAs found by the SOLE, the NLRC and the CA, the position of respondent Agoncillo was not abolished or declared redundant. In fact, the petitioners hired an entirely new set of employees to perform the tasks of respondent Agoncillo, namely:\nDon Vincent Hembrador\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Reynaldo Pajarito\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Eliza De Venecia\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Scarlet Galve\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Dheeny Laggui\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Eric Galos\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Carlota Pineda\n- hired on January 25, 1997\n[34]\nWe agree with the contention of the petitioners that it is the prerogative of management to transfer an employee from one office to another within the business establishment based on its assessment and perception of the employee's qualification, aptitude and competence, and in order to ascertain where he can function with the maximum benefit to the company. However, this Court emphasized that:\nBut, like other rights, there are limits thereto. The managerial prerogative to transfer personnel must be exercised without grave abuse of discretion, bearing in mind the basic elements of justice and fair play. Having the right should not be confused with the manner in which that right is exercised. Thus, it cannot be used as a subterfuge by the employer to rid himself of an undesirable worker. In particular, the employer must be able to show that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient or prejudicial to the employee; nor does it involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of his salaries, privileges and other benefits. Should the employer fail to overcome this burden of proof, the employee's transfer shall be tantamount to constructive dismissal, which has been defined as a quitting because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; as an offer involving a demotion in rank and diminution in pay.\n[35]\nThere is constructive dismissal when there is a demotion in rank and/or diminution in pay; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee.\n[36]\nIn the present case, the petitioners recalled the termination of respondent Agoncillo when they learned that she was going to file a complaint against them with the NLRC for illegal dismissal. However, instead of reinstating her to her former position, she was offered the position of Linen Dispatcher in the hotel basement or Secretary of the Roomskeeping Section, positions much lower than that of a Supervisor of Outlet Cashiers which the respondent held before she was promoted as Senior Front Office Cashier. With the said positions, the respondent would not certainly be receiving the same salary and other benefits as Senior Front Office Cashier.\nWe agree with the ruling of the NLRC that the offers by the petitioners to transfer respondent Agoncillo to other positions were made in bad faith, a ploy to stave off a suit for illegal dismissal. In fact, respondent Agoncillo had not been transferred to another position at all.\nSix months from the time the petitioners made offers to respondent Agoncillo, the latter never heard from the petitioners again.\nWhile the hotel gave complainant Rowena Agoncillo a second letter advising her that she was still an employee who was merely on temporary lay-off, the circumstances surrounding the issuance of such second letter is highly suspicious. To date, complainant Agoncillo's affidavit (Annex F) on the issuance of the second letter remains undisputed. It cannot be gainsaid that the second letter was issued merely to entice complainant Agoncillo to return the termination letter. The said second letter did not make mention of the termination letter. If, as claimed by the hotel, the second letter was a withdrawal of the first letter, why was there no clear statement to this effect when it could have easily been done? Why was it also necessary for the hotel's officers to retrieve the termination letter that it had issued to complainant? What we can gather from here is that the hotel had tried to cover its tracks in order to rectify an error. Certainly, good faith cannot be attributed on the part of the hotel in issuing the second letter.\n[37]\n...\nEven assuming, for the sake of argument, that the hotel had a valid ground for dismissing [the] complainant and that it had merely spared her such fate, the hotel is still guilty of illegal dismissal. Had the hotel made the transfer of complainant in good faith and in the normal course of its operation, it would have been justified. In this case, however, the supposed transfer was made only after complainant had been earlier terminated. Complainant's statement in her affidavit that she was summoned by the hotel after news of her plan to contest her dismissal circulated remains unrefuted. Furthermore, the hotel has not explained why there was no official memorandum issued to complainant formally informing her of her \"transfer\". All these lead to only one conclusion - that the alleged transfer was not made in good faith as a valid exercise of management prerogative but was intended as a settlement offer to complainant to prevent her from filing a case.\n[38]\nThe offers made by the petitioners could not have the effect of validating an otherwise arbitrary dismissal.\n[39]\nWe reject the contention of the petitioners that respondent Agoncillo is bound by the MOA executed by the petitioners and respondent Union. There is no denying the right of the Union and the petitioners under Article 227 of the Labor Code to enter into and execute a compromise agreement with the assistance of the DOLE; and that such agreement is binding not only on the Union generally but on its individual members.\n[40]\nHowever, a plain reading of the MOA will readily show that it is not binding on respondent Agoncillo. The MOA reads:\nThe Hotel shall pay the amount of P15,000.00 each to the members of the bargaining unit who are represented by the Union in this case by way of amicable settlement of the case and in addition to the redundancy pay already earlier given to such members.\nFor security purposes and an orderly proceeding, only claimants or their authorized representatives shall be allowed entry into the premises of the Hotel accompanied by Union representative.\nOn the date of application and actual payment, the claimants shall execute sworn release, waiver and quitclaim as well as a special power of attorney authorizing the Union president to amicably settle this case.\nUnclaimed settlement pay after 15 April 2000 shall be turned over to the Union for its disposition on condition that the Union shall take care of paying other claimants if any should show up to lay their claim thereafter.\nFollowing the execution of this Agreement, the Union and the Hotel shall file a manifestation and motion with the DOLE, attached this Agreement, praying for the following:\na.\nDismissal of the case with prejudice in regard to:\n(i.)\nillegal redundancy as to those who have received the settlement pay above and signed the Special Power of Attorney and Release, Waiver and Quitclaim; (ii.)\nall ULP charges; and b.\nDismissal of the case without prejudice as to those who have not yet received the settlement pay.\n[41]\nThe Union executed the MOA in behalf of the members of the bargaining unit. There is no showing that Agoncillo is a member of that unit. The MOA applies only to the members of the bargaining unit who agreed to the termination of their employment based on redundancy and received redundancy pay. Agoncillo did not receive any redundancy pay or any monetary benefits under the MOA or executed any deed or waiver or release in favor of the petitioners.\nThe MOA executed by the petitioners and the Union settled only the case of the parties before the SOLE for unfair labor practice and for illegal redundancy. It did not settle the case between the petitioners and Agoncillo before the NLRC. This is the reason why the MOA was never submitted by the parties therein to the NLRC for its approval. Although the petitioners sought a reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC based, inter alia, on the MOA, the NLRC denied the said motion. Indeed, the NLRC acted in accord with case law that:\nFirst, even if a clear majority of the union members agreed to a settlement with the employer, the union has no authority to compromise the individual claims of members who did not consent to such settlement. Rule 138, Section 23 of the 1964 Revised Rules of Court requires a special authority before an attorney may compromise his client's litigation. \"The authority to compromise cannot lightly be presumed and should be duly established by evidence.\"\nIn the case at bar, minority union members did not authorize the union to compromise their individual claims. Absent a showing of the union's special authority to compromise the individual claims of private respondents for reinstatement and back wages, there is no valid waiver of the aforesaid rights. As private respondents did not authorize the union to represent them in the compromise settlement, they are not bound by the terms thereof.\nSecond, whether minority union members who did not consent to a compromise agreement are bound by the majority decision approving a compromise settlement has been resolved in the negative.\nIn La Campana, we explicitly declared:\n\"Money claims due to laborers cannot be the object of settlement or compromise effected by a union or counsel without the specific individual consent of each laborer concerned. The beneficiaries are the individual complainants themselves. The union to which they belong can only assist them but cannot decide for them.\"\nThe case of La Campana was re-affirmed in the General Rubber case as follows:\n\"In the instant case, there is no dispute that private respondent has not ratified the Return-to-Work Agreement. It follows, and we so hold, that private respondents cannot be held bound by the Return-to-Work Agreement. The waiver of money claims, which in this case were accrued money claims, by workers and employees must be regarded as a personal right, that is, a right that must be personally exercised. For a waiver thereof to be legally effective, the individual consent or ratification of the workers or employees involved must be shown. Neither the officers nor the majority or the union had any authority to waive the accrued rights pertaining to the dissenting minority members, even under a collective bargaining agreement which provided for a \"union shop\". The same considerations of public policy which impelled the Court to reach the conclusion it did in La Campana, are equally compelling in the present case. The members of the union need the protective shield of this doctrine not only vis-à-vis their employer but also, at times, vis-a-vis the management of their own union, and at other times even against their own imprudence impecuniousness.\"\nWe have consistently ruled that \"a compromise is governed by the basic principle that the obligations arising therefrom have the force of law between the parties.\"\nConsequently, private respondents may pursue their individual claims against petitioners before the Labor Arbiter.\nThe judgment of the Labor Arbiter based on the compromise agreement in question does not have the effect of res judicata upon private respondent who did not agree thereto.\n\"A compromise, once approved by final orders of the court has the force of res judicata between the parties and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery.\" A compromise is basically a contract perfected by mere consent. \"Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.\" A compromise agreement is not valid when a party in the case has not signed the same or when someone signs for and in behalf of such party without authority to do so.\nIn SMI Fish Industries, Inc. vs. NLRC\n, this Court declared that where the compromise agreement was signed by only three of the five respondents, the non-signatories cannot be bound by that amicable settlement. This is so as a compromise agreement is a contract and cannot affect third persons who are not parties to it.\nPrivate respondents were not parties to the compromise agreement. Hence, the judgment approving such agreement cannot have the effect of res judicata upon them since the requirement of identity of parties is not satisfied.

Delarmente and Dizon offered to reinstate Agoncillo but not to her former position as Senior Front Office Cashier. Agoncillo objected but informed them that she could accept the position of Reservation Clerk.\n[11]\nHowever, no response was received.\nMeanwhile, the Hotel hired six (6) Front Office Cashiers on October 1, 1996.\n[12]\nOn October 21, 1996, Agoncillo received a telegram from the Human Resources Department of the Hotel directing her to report to Dizon as soon as possible.\n[13]\nShe was told by Dizon that the Hotel was willing to reinstate her but as an Outlet Cashier. Dizon explained that the Hotel had already hired new employees for the positions of Reservation Clerks. Agoncillo, however, pointed out that she was already an Outlet Cashier Supervisor before her promotion as Senior Front Office Cashier and that if she accepted the position, it would be an unjustified demotion on her part. Dizon, however, explained that the management wanted \"new graduates\" as \"front liners,\"\ni.e.\n, new graduates who would occupy the front desks and other sections exposed to guests. On the other hand, Agoncillo reiterated that she could accept the lower position of Reservation Clerk, but Dizon rejected the suggestion. Dizon countered that Agoncillo could be reinstated as a Room Service Cashier \"\npara nakatago\n.\" At this point, Agoncillo was irked by the comments of Dizon and asked, \"\nBakit Sir, nakakaperhuwisyo ba ang physical appearance ko?\n\" As to which Dizon replied, \"\nKasi ikaw, nagpabaya ka sa katawan mo\n.\" The conversation between them transpired in the presence and within hearing distance of other hotel employees, including Reynaldo Rasing, the president of the Union.\n[14]\nAfter Agoncillo's meeting with Dizon on October 22, 1996, the latter kept on promising to find a suitable position for her. In those meetings, Dizon always offered reinstatement to positions that do not require guest exposure like Linen Dispatcher at the hotel basement or Secretary of Roomskeeping. When Agoncillo refused, Dizon just instructed her to return. Agoncillo had no specific position or assigned task to perform.\nOn November 1, 1996, the Hotel resumed operations. On November 11, 1996, the Union filed a Notice of Strike for unfair labor practice with the DOLE.\n[15]\nOn November 12, 1996, Agoncillo with the assistance of the Union, filed a Complaint against the PHI and Dusit Hotel Nikko for illegal dismissal before the NLRC.\nMeantime, the Secretary of Labor and Employment (SOLE) assumed jurisdiction over the dispute on November 29, 1996 after the requisite strike-vote was conducted.\n[16]\nThe case was docketed as NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96.\nOn January 5, 1997, the Hotel published an advertisement in the newspaper Manila Bulletin inviting prospective applicants as guest relations agents, bell service agents/valet parkers, housekeeping agents, and sales executives. The Hotel hired 135 additional employees, mostly on probationary and contractual bases. These new workers performed tasks according to the reclassified positions under the new Job Code, in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the Hotel and the Union.\n[17]\nA total of 215 workers replaced the previously dismissed employees, including Agoncillo.\nThe Case for the Hotel The petitioner Hotel, formerly known as Hotel Nikko Manila Garden, was owned and managed by the PHI, a corporation substantially owned by Japan Airlines (JAL). In November 1995, JAL formally turned over its majority shareholdings in PHI to a Thai corporation, Dusit Thani Public Co., Ltd. (Dusit). This gave Dusit the managerial control over the Hotel, which was then renamed Dusit Hotel Nikko.\n[18]\nWith the very stiff competition in the hotel industry in mind, Dusit has set a twofold objective, namely: (1) the total renovation of the Hotel, where it had earmarked the amount of about P300,000,000.00; and (2) a complete reorganization of the Hotel's manpower complement. The renovation of the Hotel, which called for its closure, began on May 1, 1996 and ended six months thereafter. On the other hand, the reorganization was done to standardize the Hotel's organizational set-up with all Dusit Hotels around the world and train the employees for their eventual deployment to its other chain of hotels. The reorganization program started with a staff reduction program wherein employees were given the chance to voluntarily avail of the SERP. As per its guidelines, the SERP is a one-time program offered by the Hotel to its regular employees who had at least one year of service as of April 30, 1996, in order to achieve the following:\na.)\nrealize optimum operational productivity and efficiency through a reorganization that will eliminate redundant position; b.)\nreduce expenses of the company; and c.)\nprovide employees the opportunity to receive lump-sum benefits for their immediate use before the 6-month closure.\n[19]\nPursuant to the reorganization program, a reclassification of positions ensued upon resumption of the Hotel's operation. Consequently, the position of Agoncillo as Senior Front Office Cashier was abolished and a new position of Guest Services Agent absorbing its functions was created. Considering that the new position requires skills in both reception and cashiering operations, respondent Hotel deemed it necessary to transfer Agoncillo to another position as Outlet Cashier, which does not require other skills aside from cashiering.\n[20]\nThe transfer of Agoncillo from Senior Front Office Cashier to Outlet Cashier does not entail any diminution of salary or rank. Despite which, she vehemently refused the transfer and insisted that she be reinstated to her former position. Since Agoncillo was not amenable to the said transfer, she did not assume her new position and since then had stopped reporting for work despite the Hotel's patient reminder to act on the contrary. Instead, she filed a complaint to question the prerogative of the management to validly transfer her to another position as she considers the transfer an act of constructive dismissal amounting to illegal termination and unfair labor practice in the form of union busting.\n[21]\nProceedings before the Labor Arbiter, NLRC and the CA On September 18, 1997, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment dismissing the complaint for unfair labor practice and constructive dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled that the reassignment of the complainant was done by management in the valid exercise of management prerogative, and that management has not dismissed her in any way.\n[22]\nOn October 27, 1997, the complainant appealed the decision to the NLRC.\nIn the meantime, on January 6, 1998, the SOLE issued an Order in NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96 in favor of the Union. The fallo of the Order reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:\nDeclaring the termination of 243 employees, including 161 Union officers and members on April 1, 1996, illegal; Ordering the immediate reinstatement of the 243 employees, without loss of seniority rights and with full backwages and benefits from the time of their termination until actual reinstatement, less the amounts received by them on account of the Company's Special Early Retirement Program; Declaring the Company guilty of unfair labor practice for:\nimplementing an illegal redundancy program in the guise of a Special Early Retirement Program, terminating in the process 243 employees, including 161 Union officers and members; implementing a New Job and Wage Classification and Manning Standards, in violation of Article 1, Section VII of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement; and violation of the CBA provisions on entry rates of new employees and rice subsidy for retained employees who were on duty during the renovation of the Hotel.\nOrdering the Company to cease and desist from further continuing with its commission of the unfair labor practice acts herein complained of.\nSO ORDERED.", "facts": "the factual findings of the NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, are accorded high respect and finality unless the factual findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter clash with those of the NLRC and the CA in which case, the Court will have to review the records and the arguments of the parties to resolve the factual issues and render substantial justice to the parties.\n[31]\nThe petitioners reiterate their submission that respondent Agoncillo had never been dismissed; she was merely transferred to another position, that of Outlet Cashier. She had been temporarily laid off because of the renovation of the hotel but she remained as an employee of the hotel. Following the completion of the renovation of the hotel, she was offered the position of outlet cashier; but she already filed her complaint before the Hotel was able to determine what position she could occupy which was mutually acceptable. The petitioners aver that the transfer of the respondent to the position of Outlet Cashier was a valid exercise of management prerogative based on its assessment of her qualification, aptitude and competence, absent any showing to be contrary to law, morals or public policy, unreasonable, inconvenient and prejudicial to the employee. The petitioners insist that the transfer of Agoncillo was pursuant to its objective of completely reorganizing its manpower component. It did not entail any diminution in salary, benefits, privileges or job level. The petitioners also maintain that even if the respondent was separated from the Hotel, it was justified to do so due to redundancy. The validity of the said program was even recognized by the respondents in the MOA executed by petitioner Hotel and the respondent Union. The petitioners maintain that the respondents are bound by the MOA.\nThe contentions are untenable. It is plain as day that the petitioners terminated the employment of respondent Agoncillo effective April 30, 1996, as evidenced by their letter which reads:\nApril 1, 1996 Ms. Rowena Agoncillo Parañaque, Metro Manila Dear Ms. Agoncillo:\nWe have recently conducted a study of the Hotel's organizational structure and found the need to reorganize the same and eliminate many positions that have become redundant.\nAs a result of such study, it was determined that your position as Senior Front Office Cashier is redundant. In this connection, please be advised of your separation from service due to redundancy, effective close of office hours of April 30, 1996. You will receive not later than April 30, 1996 the separation pay provided for under the law, plus the amount of P19,000.00.\nWe take this opportunity to thank you for your service to Hotel Nikko Manila Garden and extend to you our best wishes for your next endeavors.\nVery truly yours, (Sgd.)\nPEARL V. ARAGON Director for Administration\n[32]\nThe letter of the petitioners terminating the employment of Agoncillo on the ground of redundancy was rejected by the Order of the SOLE in NCMB-NCR-NS-11-425-96 where he ruled that the petitioners' redundancy program was but a ploy, a contrivance cunningly scripted by them to subvert the Union and unlawfully dismiss many of its employees. The SOLE declared that, by their acts, the petitioners were guilty of unfair labor practice.\nRedundancy exists when the service capability of the workforce is in excess of what is reasonably needed to meet the demands of the business enterprise. A reasonably redundant position is one rendered superfluous by any number of factors, such as overhiring of workers, decreased volume of business, dropping of a particular product line previously manufactured by the company or phasing out of service activity priorly undertaken by the business. Among the requisites of a valid redundancy program are: (1) the good faith of the employer in abolishing the redundant position; and (2) fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining what positions are to be declared redundant and accordingly abolished.\n[33]\nAs found by the SOLE, the NLRC and the CA, the position of respondent Agoncillo was not abolished or declared redundant. In fact, the petitioners hired an entirely new set of employees to perform the tasks of respondent Agoncillo, namely:\nDon Vincent Hembrador\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Reynaldo Pajarito\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Eliza De Venecia\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Scarlet Galve\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Dheeny Laggui\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Eric Galos\n- hired on October 1, 1996 Carlota Pineda\n- hired on January 25, 1997\n[34]\nWe agree with the contention of the petitioners that it is the prerogative of management to transfer an employee from one office to another within the business establishment based on its assessment and perception of the employee's qualification, aptitude and competence, and in order to ascertain where he can function with the maximum benefit to the company. However, this Court emphasized that:\nBut, like other rights, there are limits thereto. The managerial prerogative to transfer personnel must be exercised without grave abuse of discretion, bearing in mind the basic elements of justice and fair play. Having the right should not be confused with the manner in which that right is exercised. Thus, it cannot be used as a subterfuge by the employer to rid himself of an undesirable worker. In particular, the employer must be able to show that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient or prejudicial to the employee; nor does it involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of his salaries, privileges and other benefits. Should the employer fail to overcome this burden of proof, the employee's transfer shall be tantamount to constructive dismissal, which has been defined as a quitting because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; as an offer involving a demotion in rank and diminution in pay.\n[35]\nThere is constructive dismissal when there is a demotion in rank and/or diminution in pay; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee.\n[36]\nIn the present case, the petitioners recalled the termination of respondent Agoncillo when they learned that she was going to file a complaint against them with the NLRC for illegal dismissal. However, instead of reinstating her to her former position, she was offered the position of Linen Dispatcher in the hotel basement or Secretary of the Roomskeeping Section, positions much lower than that of a Supervisor of Outlet Cashiers which the respondent held before she was promoted as Senior Front Office Cashier. With the said positions, the respondent would not certainly be receiving the same salary and other benefits as Senior Front Office Cashier.\nWe agree with", "issues": "The issues for resolution are factual and Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari\n.

Should the employer fail to overcome this burden of proof, the employee's transfer shall be tantamount to constructive dismissal, which has been defined as a quitting because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; as an offer involving a demotion in rank and diminution in pay.\n[35]\nThere is constructive dismissal when there is a demotion in rank and/or diminution in pay; or when a clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer becomes unbearable to the employee.\n[36]\nIn the present case, the petitioners recalled the termination of respondent Agoncillo when they learned that she was going to file a complaint against them with the NLRC for illegal dismissal. However, instead of reinstating her to her former position, she was offered the position of Linen Dispatcher in the hotel basement or Secretary of the Roomskeeping Section, positions much lower than that of a Supervisor of Outlet Cashiers which the respondent held before she was promoted as Senior Front Office Cashier. With the said positions, the respondent would not certainly be receiving the same salary and other benefits as Senior Front Office Cashier.\nWe agree with the ruling of the NLRC that the offers by the petitioners to transfer respondent Agoncillo to other positions were made in bad faith, a ploy to stave off a suit for illegal dismissal. In fact, respondent Agoncillo had not been transferred to another position at all.\nSix months from the time the petitioners made offers to respondent Agoncillo, the latter never heard from the petitioners again.\nWhile the hotel gave complainant Rowena Agoncillo a second letter advising her that she was still an employee who was merely on temporary lay-off, the circumstances surrounding the issuance of such second letter is highly suspicious. To date, complainant Agoncillo's affidavit (Annex F) on the issuance of the second letter remains undisputed. It cannot be gainsaid that the second letter was issued merely to entice complainant Agoncillo to return the termination letter. The said second letter did not make mention of the termination letter. If, as claimed by the hotel, the second letter was a withdrawal of the first letter, why was there no clear statement to this effect when it could have easily been done? Why was it also necessary for the hotel's officers to retrieve the termination letter that it had issued to complainant? What we can gather from here is that the hotel had tried to cover its tracks in order to rectify an error. Certainly, good faith cannot be attributed on the part of the hotel in issuing the second letter.\n[37]\n...\nEven assuming, for the sake of argument, that the hotel had a valid ground for dismissing [the] complainant and that it had merely spared her such fate, the hotel is still guilty of illegal dismissal. Had the hotel made the transfer of complainant in good faith and in the normal course of its operation, it would have been justified. In this case, however, the supposed transfer was made only after complainant had been earlier terminated. Complainant's statement in her affidavit that she was summoned by the hotel after news of her plan to contest her dismissal circulated remains unrefuted. Furthermore, the hotel has not explained why there was no official memorandum issued to complainant formally informing her of her \"transfer\". All these lead to only one conclusion - that the alleged transfer was not made in good faith as a valid exercise of management prerogative but was intended as a settlement offer to complainant to prevent her from filing a case.\n[38]\nThe offers made by the petitioners could not have the effect of validating an otherwise arbitrary dismissal.\n[39]\nWe reject the contention of the petitioners that respondent Agoncillo is bound by the MOA executed by the petitioners and respondent Union. There is no denying the right of the Union and the petitioners under Article 227 of the Labor Code to enter into and execute a compromise agreement with the assistance of the DOLE; and that such agreement is binding not only on the Union generally but on its individual members.\n[40]\nHowever, a plain reading of the MOA will readily show that it is not binding on respondent Agoncillo. The MOA reads:\nThe Hotel shall pay the amount of P15,000.00 each to the members of the bargaining unit who are represented by the Union in this case by way of amicable settlement of the case and in addition to the redundancy pay already earlier given to such members.\nFor security purposes and an orderly proceeding, only claimants or their authorized representatives shall be allowed entry into the premises of the Hotel accompanied by Union representative.\nOn the date of application and actual payment, the claimants shall execute sworn release, waiver and quitclaim as well as a special power of attorney authorizing the Union president to amicably settle this case.\nUnclaimed settlement pay after 15 April 2000 shall be turned over to the Union for its disposition on condition that the Union shall take care of paying other claimants if any should show up to lay their claim thereafter.\nFollowing the execution of this Agreement, the Union and the Hotel shall file a manifestation and motion with the DOLE, attached this Agreement, praying for the following:\na.\nDismissal of the case with prejudice in regard to:\n(i.)\nillegal redundancy as to those who have received the settlement pay above and signed the Special Power of Attorney and Release, Waiver and Quitclaim; (ii.)\nall ULP charges; and b.\nDismissal of the case without prejudice as to those who have not yet received the settlement pay.\n[41]\nThe Union executed the MOA in behalf of the members of the bargaining unit. There is no showing that Agoncillo is a member of that unit. The MOA applies only to the members of the bargaining unit who agreed to the termination of their employment based on redundancy and received redundancy pay. Agoncillo did not receive any redundancy pay or any monetary benefits under the MOA or executed any deed or waiver or release in favor of the petitioners.\nThe MOA executed by the petitioners and the Union settled only the case of the parties before the SOLE for unfair labor practice and for illegal redundancy. It did not settle the case between the petitioners and Agoncillo before the NLRC. This is the reason why the MOA was never submitted by the parties therein to the NLRC for its approval. Although the petitioners sought a reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC based, inter alia, on the MOA, the NLRC denied the said motion. Indeed, the NLRC acted in accord with case law that:\nFirst, even if a clear majority of the union members agreed to a settlement with the employer, the union has no authority to compromise the individual claims of members who did not consent to such settlement. Rule 138, Section 23 of the 1964 Revised Rules of Court requires a special authority before an attorney may compromise his client's litigation. \"The authority to compromise cannot lightly be presumed and should be duly established by evidence.\"\nIn the case at bar, minority union members did not authorize the union to compromise their individual claims. Absent a showing of the union's special authority to compromise the individual claims of private respondents for reinstatement and back wages, there is no valid waiver of the aforesaid rights. As private respondents did not authorize the union to represent them in the compromise settlement, they are not bound by the terms thereof.\nSecond, whether minority union members who did not consent to a compromise agreement are bound by the majority decision approving a compromise settlement has been resolved in the negative.\nIn La Campana, we explicitly declared:\n\"Money claims due to laborers cannot be the object of settlement or compromise effected by a union or counsel without the specific individual consent of each laborer concerned. The beneficiaries are the individual complainants themselves. The union to which they belong can only assist them but cannot decide for them.\"\nThe case of La Campana was re-affirmed in the General Rubber case as follows:\n\"In the instant case, there is no dispute that private respondent has not ratified the Return-to-Work Agreement. It follows, and we so hold, that private respondents cannot be held bound by the Return-to-Work Agreement. The waiver of money claims, which in this case were accrued money claims, by workers and employees must be regarded as a personal right, that is, a right that must be personally exercised. For a waiver thereof to be legally effective, the individual consent or ratification of the workers or employees involved must be shown. Neither the officers nor the majority or the union had any authority to waive the accrued rights pertaining to the dissenting minority members, even under a collective bargaining agreement which provided for a \"union shop\". The same considerations of public policy which impelled the Court to reach the conclusion it did in La Campana, are equally compelling in the present case. The members of the union need the protective shield of this doctrine not only vis-à-vis their employer but also, at times, vis-a-vis the management of their own union, and at other times even against their own imprudence impecuniousness.\"\nWe have consistently ruled that \"a compromise is governed by the basic principle that the obligations arising therefrom have the force of law between the parties.\"\nConsequently, private respondents may pursue their individual claims against petitioners before the Labor Arbiter.\nThe judgment of the Labor Arbiter based on the compromise agreement in question does not have the effect of res judicata upon private respondent who did not agree thereto.\n\"A compromise, once approved by final orders of the court has the force of res judicata between the parties and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery.\" A compromise is basically a contract perfected by mere consent. \"Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract.\" A compromise agreement is not valid when a party in the case has not signed the same or when someone signs for and in behalf of such party without authority to do so.\nIn SMI Fish Industries, Inc. vs. NLRC\n, this Court declared that where the compromise agreement was signed by only three of the five respondents, the non-signatories cannot be bound by that amicable settlement. This is so as a compromise agreement is a contract and cannot affect third persons who are not parties to it.\nPrivate respondents were not parties to the compromise agreement. Hence, the judgment approving such agreement cannot have the effect of res judicata upon them since the requirement of identity of parties is not satisfied. A judgment upon a compromise agreement has all the force and effect of any other judgment, hence, conclusive only upon parties thereto and their privies.\n[42]\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING\n, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

VILLAROSA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE OF OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENT.\nDECISION CALLEJO, SR., J.:\nBefore the Court is the petition for review on certiorari filed by Ramon M. Atienza, in his capacity as Vice-Governor of the Province of Occidental Mindoro, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision\n[1]\ndated November 28, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 72069. The assailed decision dismissed the petition for prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Atienza which had sought to enjoin the implementation of the Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 issued by Jose T. Villarosa, Governor of the same province.\nThe present case arose from the following undisputed facts:\nPetitioner Atienza and respondent Villarosa were the Vice-Governor and Governor, respectively, of the Province of Occidental Mindoro. On June 26, 2002, the petitioner Vice-Governor received the Memorandum dated June 25, 2002 issued by the respondent Governor concerning the \"AUTHORITY TO SIGN PURCHASE ORDERS OF SUPPLIES, MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT[S], INCLUDING FUEL, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN.\n\" The said memorandum reads:\nFor proper coordination and to ensure efficient and effective local government administration particularly on matters pertaining to supply and property management, effective immediately, all Purchase Orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials and equipment[s] including fuel, repairs and maintenance needed in the transaction of public business or in the pursuit of any undertaking, project or activity of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, this province, shall be approved by the undersigned in his capacity as the local chief executive of the province.\nThe provision of DILG Opinion No. 148-1993 which states that the authority to sign Purchase Orders of supplies, materials and equipment[s] of the Sanggunian belongs to the local chief executive, serves as basis of this memorandum.\nFor strict compliance.\n[2]\nIn reply to the above memorandum, the petitioner Vice-Governor wrote the respondent Governor stating that:\nWe are of the opinion that . . . purchase orders for supplies, materials and equipment are included under those as authorized for signature by the Vice-chief executive of the Sanggunian on the basis of the DILG Opinion No. 96-1995 as affirmed by the COA Opinions on June 28, April 11 and February 9, 1994 and coursing it to the Governor for his approval is no longer necessary, the fact that [Secs.] 466 and 468, RA 7160 already provides for the separation of powers between the executive and legislative. Such authority even include everything necessary for the legislative research program of the Sanggunian.\n[3]\nUnimpressed, the respondent Governor issued the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 relating to the \"TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF SERVICES OF CASUAL/JOB ORDER EMPLOYEES AND REAPPOINTMENT OF THE RESPECTIVE RECOMMENDEES.\" The said memorandum reads:\nFor faithful and appropriate enforcement and execution of laws and issuances and to promote efficiency in the government service, effective immediately, all existing contract of employment – casual/job order basis and reappointment of the recommendees – entered into by Vice-Governor Ramon M. Atienza are hereby terminated for being unauthorized.\nAside from being signed by the unauthorized signatory, the following facts regarding the appointments were considered:\nThe appointment of 28 clerks – on top of existing permanent employees – is a clear manifestation of an excessive and bloated bureaucracy; The appointment of an X-ray Technician detailed at the Provincial Health Office and some clerks detailed at various offices in the province were not proper to be assigned by the Vice-Governor; The appointment of 30 messengers, utility workers and drivers ran counter to COA Opinion as cited in the letter of the undersigned dated 28 June 2002, addressed to the Vice-Governor.\nHowever, in order to accommodate the Vice-Governor and the members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, the undersigned, in his capacity as the local chief executive of the province, will allow four (4) casual/job order employees to be assigned to the Vice-Governor and one (1) casual/job order employee to be assigned to each member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\nThe Vice-Governor and all the Sanggunian Members are hereby directed to submit immediately the names of their recommendees to the undersigned for immediate approval of their respective appointments.\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n[4]\nOn July 3, 2002, the respondent Governor issued another Memorandum regarding the \"ENFORCIBILITY (sic) OF PREVIOUS MEMORANDA ISSUED ON JUNE 20, 26 AND JULY 1, 2002.\" It provides that:\nPlease be properly advised that the Memoranda dated June 20, 26 and July 1, 2002 issued by the undersigned regarding the issuance of permit to travel and authority to sign Purchase Orders of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, is to be strictly adhered to for compliance.\nLikewise for strict compliance is the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 with reference to the Cancellation of the Appointment of Casual/Job Order Employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members/Office of the Vice-Governor previously signed by Vice-Governor Ramon M. Atienza.\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n[5]\nIn his Letter dated July 9, 2002, the petitioner Vice-Governor invoked the principle of separation of powers as applied to the local government units, i.e., the respondent, as the Governor, the head of the executive branch, and the petitioner, as the Vice-Governor, the head of the legislative branch, which is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor reiterated his request for the respondent to make a \"deeper study\" on the matter before implementing his memoranda. The request, however, went unheeded as the respondent Governor insisted on obliging the department heads of the provincial government to comply with the memoranda.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor thus filed with the Court of Appeals the petition for prohibition assailing as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion the respondent Governor's Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002. The petitioner Vice-Governor claimed that these memoranda excluded him from the use and enjoyment of his office in violation of the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, and its implementing rules and regulations. It was prayed that the respondent Governor be enjoined from implementing the assailed memoranda.\nThe appellate court, in its Decision dated November 28, 2003, dismissed the petition for prohibition. Citing Section 344\n[6]\nof Rep. Act No. 7160, the CA upheld the authority of the respondent Governor to issue the Memorandum dated June 25, 2002 as it recognized his authority to approve the purchase orders. The said provision provides in part that \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\"\nThe CA explained that Section 466(a)(1)\n[7]\nof the same Code, relied upon by the petitioner Vice-Governor, speaks of the authority of the Vice-Governor to sign \"all warrants drawn on the public treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n\" In declaring this provision inapplicable, the CA reasoned that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the public treasury.\nSection 361\n[8]\nwas, likewise, held to be inapplicable ratiocinating, thus:\n[R]equisitioning, which is provided under Section 361 of RA 7160, is the act of requiring that something be furnished. In the procurement function, it is the submission of written requests for supplies and materials and the like. It could be inferred that, in the scheme of things, approval of purchase requests is different from approval of purchase orders. Thus, the inapplicability of Section 361.\nAnent the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002, the CA ruled that the issue on whether it could be enjoined had already been rendered moot and academic. The CA pointed out that the subject of the said memorandum could no longer be enjoined or restrained as the termination of the employees had already been effected. It opined that where the act sought to be enjoined in the prohibition proceedings had already been performed and there is nothing more to restrain, the case is already moot and academic.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor now seeks recourse to this Court alleging that the appellate court committed reversible error in ruling that it is the Governor, and not the Vice-Governor, who has the authority to sign purchase orders of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor, likewise, takes exception to the holding of the CA that the issue relating to the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had been rendered moot and academic. He points out that the appointment of casual/job order employees is exercised by the appointing authority every six months in the case of casual employees and per job order as to job order employees. Thus, while the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had already been implemented, what is being sought to be enjoined is the respondent Governor's continued usurpation of the petitioner Vice-Governor's authority to appoint the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan under the pertinent provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nFor his part, the respondent Governor maintains that his Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 are valid\n.\nHe asserts that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the provincial treasury under Section 466(a)(1) of Rep. Act No. 7160. Rather, he insists on the application of the last clause in Section 344 which states that the approval of the disbursement by the local chief executive is required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nThe respondent Governor likewise defends the validity of the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 stating that it was issued upon finding that the petitioner Vice-Governor appointed, among others, 28 clerks on top of the existing permanent employees resulting in an excessive and bloated bureaucracy. He concedes the appointing power of the Vice-Governor but submits that this is limited to the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and that he is not authorized to appoint officials and employees of the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nAs correctly presented by the appellate court, the issues for resolution in this case are:\nA. Who between the petitioner and the respondent is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan?\nB. Does respondent Villarosa, as local chief executive, have the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members and the Office of the Vice-Governor?\n[9]\nBefore resolving the foregoing issues, it is noted that petitioner Atienza and respondent Villarosa had ceased to be the Vice-Governor and Governor, respectively, of the Province of Occidental Mindoro effective June 30, 2004 when the newly-elected officials of the province took their oaths of offices. The petitioner Vice-Governor did not run for re-election during the May 2004 elections while the respondent Governor did not succeed in his re-election bid\n.\nThe expiration of their terms of offices has effectively rendered the case moot. However, even in cases where supervening events had made the cases moot, the Court did not hesitate to resolve the legal or constitutional issues raised to formulate controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and the public.\n[10]\nIn this case, there is compelling reason for the Court to resolve the issues presented in order to clarify the scope of the respective powers of the Governor and Vice-Governor under the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991.\nTo resolve the substantive issues presented in the instant case, it is well to recall that Rep. Act No. 7160 was enacted to give flesh to the constitutional mandate to \"provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanism of recall, initiative and referendum, allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.\"\n[11]\nIn this connection, the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160 are anchored on principles that give effect to decentralization. Among these principles are: [t]here shall be an effective allocation among the different local government units of their respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and resources; [t]here shall be established in every local government unit an accountable, efficient, and dynamic organizational structure and operating mechanism that will meet the priority needs and service requirements of its communities; [p]rovinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions; and [e]ffective mechanisms for ensuring the accountability of local government units to their respective constituents shall be strengthened in order to upgrade continually the quality of local leadership.\n[12]\nWith these guideposts, the Court shall now address the issue on who between the Governor and Vice-Governor is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nWe hold that it is the Vice-Governor who has such authority.\nUnder Rep. Act No. 7160, local legislative power for the province is exercised by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n[13]\nand the Vice-Governor is its presiding officer.\n[14]\nBeing vested with legislative powers, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan enacts ordinances, resolutions and appropriates funds for the general welfare of the province in accordance with the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\n[15]\nThe same statute vests upon the Vice-Governor the power to:\n(1) Be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan and sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n[16]\nFurther, Section 344 provides:\nSec. 344.\nCertification on, and Approval of, Vouchers.\n– No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to validity, propriety and legality of the claim involved. Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses such as payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as the GSIS, SSS, LBP, DBP, National Printing Office, Procurement Service of the DBM and others, approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nIn cases of special or trust funds, disbursements shall be approved by the administrator of the fund.\nIn case of temporary absence or incapacity of the department head or chief of office, the officer next-in-rank shall automatically perform his function and he shall be fully responsible therefor.\nReliance by the CA on the clause \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed\" of the above section (Section 344) to rule that it is the Governor who has the authority to approve purchase orders for the supplies, materials or equipment for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is misplaced. This clause cannot prevail over the more specific clause of the same provision which provides that \"vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned.\" The Vice-Governor, as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has administrative control of the funds of the said body. Accordingly, it is the Vice-Governor who has the authority to approve disbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nOn this point, Section 39 of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System for Local Government Units, prepared by the Commission on Audit (COA), is instructive:\nSec. 39.\nApproval of Disbursements.\n– Approval of disbursements by the Local Chief Executive (LCE) himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed, except for regularly recurring administrative expenses such as: payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as GSIS, BIR, PHILHEALTH, LBP, DBP, NPO, PS of the DBM and others, where the authority to approve may be delegated.\nDisbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sanggunian shall be approved by the provincial Vice Governor, the city Vice-Mayor or the municipal Vice-Mayor, as the case may be.\n[17]\nWhile Rep. Act No. 7160 is silent as to the matter, the authority granted to the Vice-Governor to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as to approve disbursement vouchers relating thereto necessarily includes the authority to approve purchase orders covering the same applying the doctrine of necessary implication. This doctrine is explained, thus:\nNo statute can be enacted that can provide all the details involved in its application. There is always an omission that may not meet a particular situation. What is thought, at the time of enactment, to be an all-embracing legislation may be inadequate to provide for the unfolding of events of the future. So-called gaps in the law develop as the law is enforced. One of the rules of statutory construction used to fill in the gap is the doctrine of necessary implication. The doctrine states that what is implied in a statute is as much a part thereof as that which is expressed. Every statute is understood, by implication, to contain all such provisions as may be necessary to effectuate its object and purpose, or to make effective rights, powers, privileges or jurisdiction which it grants, including all such collateral and subsidiary consequences as may be fairly and logically inferred from its terms.\nEx necessitate legis.\nAnd every statutory grant of power, right or privilege is deemed to include all incidental power, right or privilege. This is so because the greater includes the lesser, expressed in the maxim, in eo plus sit, simper inest et minus.\n[18]\nWarrants are \"order[s] directing the treasurer of the municipality to pay money out of funds in city treasury which are or may become available for purpose specified to designated person[s].\"\n[19]\nWarrants of a municipal corporation are generally orders payable when funds are found. They are issued for the payment of general municipal debts and expenses subject to the rule that they shall be paid in the order of presentation.\n[20]\nThe ordinary meaning of \"voucher\" is a document which shows that services have been performed or expenses incurred. It covers any acquittance or receipt discharging the person or evidencing payment by him. When used in connection with disbursement of money, it implies some instrument that shows on what account or by what authority a particular payment has been made, or that services have been performed which entitle the party to whom it is issued to payment.\n[21]\nPurchase order, on the other hand, is \"an authorization by the issuing party for the recipient to provide materials or services for which issuing party agrees to pay; it is an offer to buy which becomes binding when those things ordered have been provided.\"\n[22]\nWhen an authorized person approves a disbursement voucher, he certifies to the correctness of the entries therein, among others: that the expenses incurred were necessary and lawful, the supporting documents are complete and the availability of cash therefor. Further, the person who performed the services or delivered the supplies, materials or equipment is entitled to payment.\n[23]\nOn the other hand, the terms and conditions for the procurement of supplies, materials or equipment, in particular, are contained in a purchase order. The tenor of a purchase order basically directs the supplier to deliver the articles enumerated and subject to the terms and conditions specified therein.\n[24]\nHence, the express authority to approve disbursement vouchers and, in effect, authorize the payment of money claims for supplies, materials or equipment, necessarily includes the authority to approve purchase orders to cause the delivery of the said supplies, materials or equipment.\nSince it is the Vice-Governor who approves disbursement vouchers and approves the payment for the procurement of the supplies, materials and equipment needed for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, then he also has the authority to approve the purchase orders to cause the delivery of the said supplies, materials or equipment.\nIndeed, the authority granted to the Vice-Governor to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as to approve disbursement vouchers relating thereto is greater and includes the authority to approve purchase orders for the procurement of the supplies, materials and equipment necessary for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nAnent the second issue, the appellate court likewise committed reversible error in holding that the implementation of the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 had rendered the petition moot and academic. It is recognized that courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is \"capable of repetition yet evading review.\"\n[25]\nEven if the employees whose contractual or job order employment had been terminated by the implementation of the July 1, 2002 Memorandum may no longer be reinstated, still, similar memoranda may be issued by other local chief executives. Hence, it behooves the Court to resolve whether the Governor has the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nWe hold that the Governor, with respect to the appointment of the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has no such authority.\nAmong the powers granted to the Governor under Section 465 of Rep. Act No. 7160 are:\nSec. 465.\nThe Chief Executive: Powers, Duties, Functions and Compensation.\n– (a) The provincial governor, as the chief executive of the provincial government, shall exercise such powers and perform such duties and functions as provided by this Code and other laws.\n(b) For efficient, effective and economical governance the purpose of which is the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of this Code, the provincial governor shall:\n...\n(v) Appoint all officials and employees whose salaries and wages are wholly or mainly paid out of provincial funds and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in this Code, as well as those he may be authorized by law to appoint.\nOn the other hand, Section 466 vests on the Vice-Governor the power to, among others:\n(2) Subject to civil service law, rules and regulations, appoint all officials and employees of the sangguniang panlalawigan, except those whose manner of appointment is specifically provided in this Code.\nThus, while the Governor has the authority to appoint officials and employees whose salaries are paid out of the provincial funds, this does not extend to the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan because such authority is lodged with the Vice-Governor. In the same manner, the authority to appoint casual and job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan belongs to the Vice-Governor.\nThe authority of the Vice-Governor to appoint the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is anchored on the fact that the salaries of these employees are derived from the appropriation specifically for the said local legislative body. Indeed, the budget source of their salaries is what sets the employees and officials of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan apart from the other employees and officials of the province. Accordingly, the appointing power of the Vice-Governor is limited to those employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, as well as those of the Office of the Vice-Governor, whose salaries are paid out of the funds appropriated for the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. As a corollary, if the salary of an employee or official is charged against the provincial funds, even if this employee reports to the Vice-Governor or is assigned to his office, the Governor retains the authority to appoint the said employee pursuant to Section 465(b)(v) of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nHowever, in this case, it does not appear whether the contractual/job order employees, whose appointments were terminated or cancelled by the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 issued by the respondent Governor, were paid out of the provincial funds or the funds of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\nNonetheless, the validity of the said memorandum cannot be upheld because it absolutely prohibited the respondent Vice-Governor from exercising his authority to appoint the employees, whether regular or contractual/job order, of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and restricted such authority to one of recommendatory nature only.\n[26]\nThis clearly constituted an encroachment on the appointment power of the respondent Vice-Governor under Section 466(a)(2) of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nAt this juncture, it is well to note that under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, the Local Government Code prior to Rep. Act No. 7160, the Governor was the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n:\nSec. 205.\nComposition.\n(1) Each provincial government shall have a provincial legislature hereinafter known as the sangguniang panlalawigan\n, upon which shall be vested the provincial legislative power.\n(2) The sangguniang panlalawigan shall be composed of the governor, vice-governor, elective members of the said sanggunian\n, and the presidents of the katipunang panlalawigan and the kabataang barangay provincial federation who shall be appointed by the President of the Philippines.\n...\nSec. 206. Sessions. –\n(3) The governor, who shall be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan\n, shall not be entitled to vote except in case of a tie.\n...\nWith Rep. Act No. 7160, the union of legislative and executive powers in the office of the local chief executive under the BP Blg. 337 has been disbanded, so that either department now comprises different and non-intermingling official personalities with the end in view of ensuring a better delivery of public service and provide a system of check and balance between the two.\n[27]\nSenator Aquilino Pimentel, the principal author of Rep. Act No. 7160, explained that \"the Vice-Governor is now the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\nThe City Vice-Mayor presides at meetings of the Sangguniang Panlungsod and the Municipal Vice-Mayor at the sessions of the Sangguniang Bayan.\nThe idea is to distribute powers among elective local officials so that the legislative, which is the Sanggunian, can properly check the executive, which is the Governor or the Mayor and vice versa and exercise their functions without any undue interference from one by the other.\"\n[28]\nThe avowed intent of Rep. Act. No. 7160, therefore, is to vest on the Sangguniang Panlalawigan independence in the exercise of its legislative functions vis-a-vis the discharge by the Governor of the executive functions. The Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 of the respondent Governor, which effectively excluded the petitioner Vice-Governor, the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, from signing the purchase orders for the procurement of supplies, materials or equipment needed for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as from appointing its casual and job order employees, constituted undue interference with the latter's functions. The assailed memoranda are clearly not in keeping with the intent of Rep. Act No. 7160 and their implementation should thus be permanently enjoined.\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED\n.

Atienza.\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n[5]\nIn his Letter dated July 9, 2002, the petitioner Vice-Governor invoked the principle of separation of powers as applied to the local government units, i.e., the respondent, as the Governor, the head of the executive branch, and the petitioner, as the Vice-Governor, the head of the legislative branch, which is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor reiterated his request for the respondent to make a \"deeper study\" on the matter before implementing his memoranda. The request, however, went unheeded as the respondent Governor insisted on obliging the department heads of the provincial government to comply with the memoranda.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor thus filed with the Court of Appeals the petition for prohibition assailing as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion the respondent Governor's Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002. The petitioner Vice-Governor claimed that these memoranda excluded him from the use and enjoyment of his office in violation of the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, and its implementing rules and regulations. It was prayed that the respondent Governor be enjoined from implementing the assailed memoranda.\nThe appellate court, in its Decision dated November 28, 2003, dismissed the petition for prohibition. Citing Section 344\n[6]\nof Rep. Act No. 7160, the CA upheld the authority of the respondent Governor to issue the Memorandum dated June 25, 2002 as it recognized his authority to approve the purchase orders. The said provision provides in part that \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\"\nThe CA explained that Section 466(a)(1)\n[7]\nof the same Code, relied upon by the petitioner Vice-Governor, speaks of the authority of the Vice-Governor to sign \"all warrants drawn on the public treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n\" In declaring this provision inapplicable, the CA reasoned that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the public treasury.\nSection 361\n[8]\nwas, likewise, held to be inapplicable ratiocinating, thus:\n[R]equisitioning, which is provided under Section 361 of RA 7160, is the act of requiring that something be furnished. In the procurement function, it is the submission of written requests for supplies and materials and the like. It could be inferred that, in the scheme of things, approval of purchase requests is different from approval of purchase orders. Thus, the inapplicability of Section 361.\nAnent the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002, the CA ruled that the issue on whether it could be enjoined had already been rendered moot and academic. The CA pointed out that the subject of the said memorandum could no longer be enjoined or restrained as the termination of the employees had already been effected. It opined that where the act sought to be enjoined in the prohibition proceedings had already been performed and there is nothing more to restrain, the case is already moot and academic.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor now seeks recourse to this Court alleging that the appellate court committed reversible error in ruling that it is the Governor, and not the Vice-Governor, who has the authority to sign purchase orders of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor, likewise, takes exception to the holding of the CA that the issue relating to the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had been rendered moot and academic. He points out that the appointment of casual/job order employees is exercised by the appointing authority every six months in the case of casual employees and per job order as to job order employees. Thus, while the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had already been implemented, what is being sought to be enjoined is the respondent Governor's continued usurpation of the petitioner Vice-Governor's authority to appoint the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan under the pertinent provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nFor his part, the respondent Governor maintains that his Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 are valid\n.\nHe asserts that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the provincial treasury under Section 466(a)(1) of Rep. Act No. 7160. Rather, he insists on the application of the last clause in Section 344 which states that the approval of the disbursement by the local chief executive is required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nThe respondent Governor likewise defends the validity of the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 stating that it was issued upon finding that the petitioner Vice-Governor appointed, among others, 28 clerks on top of the existing permanent employees resulting in an excessive and bloated bureaucracy. He concedes the appointing power of the Vice-Governor but submits that this is limited to the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and that he is not authorized to appoint officials and employees of the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nAs correctly presented by the appellate court, the issues for resolution in this case are:\nA. Who between the petitioner and the respondent is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan?\nB. Does respondent Villarosa, as local chief executive, have the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members and the Office of the Vice-Governor?\n[9]\nBefore resolving the foregoing issues, it is noted that petitioner Atienza and respondent Villarosa had ceased to be the Vice-Governor and Governor, respectively, of the Province of Occidental Mindoro effective June 30, 2004 when the newly-elected officials of the province took their oaths of offices. The petitioner Vice-Governor did not run for re-election during the May 2004 elections while the respondent Governor did not succeed in his re-election bid\n.\nThe expiration of their terms of offices has effectively rendered the case moot. However, even in cases where supervening events had made the cases moot, the Court did not hesitate to resolve the legal or constitutional issues raised to formulate controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and the public.\n[10]\nIn this case, there is compelling reason for the Court to resolve the issues presented in order to clarify the scope of the respective powers of the Governor and Vice-Governor under the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991.\nTo resolve the substantive issues presented in the instant case, it is well to recall that Rep. Act No. 7160 was enacted to give flesh to the constitutional mandate to \"provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanism of recall, initiative and referendum, allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.\"\n[11]\nIn this connection, the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160 are anchored on principles that give effect to decentralization. Among these principles are: [t]here shall be an effective allocation among the different local government units of their respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and resources; [t]here shall be established in every local government unit an accountable, efficient, and dynamic organizational structure and operating mechanism that will meet the priority needs and service requirements of its communities; [p]rovinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions; and [e]ffective mechanisms for ensuring the accountability of local government units to their respective constituents shall be strengthened in order to upgrade continually the quality of local leadership.\n[12]\nWith these guideposts, the Court shall now address the issue on who between the Governor and Vice-Governor is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nWe hold that it is the Vice-Governor who has such authority.\nUnder Rep. Act No. 7160, local legislative power for the province is exercised by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n[13]\nand the Vice-Governor is its presiding officer.\n[14]\nBeing vested with legislative powers, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan enacts ordinances, resolutions and appropriates funds for the general welfare of the province in accordance with the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\n[15]\nThe same statute vests upon the Vice-Governor the power to:\n(1) Be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan and sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n[16]\nFurther, Section 344 provides:\nSec. 344.\nCertification on, and Approval of, Vouchers.\n– No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to validity, propriety and legality of the claim involved. Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses such as payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as the GSIS, SSS, LBP, DBP, National Printing Office, Procurement Service of the DBM and others, approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nIn cases of special or trust funds, disbursements shall be approved by the administrator of the fund.\nIn case of temporary absence or incapacity of the department head or chief of office, the officer next-in-rank shall automatically perform his function and he shall be fully responsible therefor.\nReliance by the CA on the clause \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed\" of the above section (Section 344) to rule that it is the Governor who has the authority to approve purchase orders for the supplies, materials or equipment for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is misplaced. This clause cannot prevail over the more specific clause of the same provision which provides that \"vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned.\" The Vice-Governor, as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has administrative control of the funds of the said body. Accordingly, it is the Vice-Governor who has the authority to approve disbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nOn this point, Section 39 of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System for Local Government Units, prepared by the Commission on Audit (COA), is instructive:\nSec. 39.\nApproval of Disbursements.\n– Approval of disbursements by the Local Chief Executive (LCE) himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed, except for regularly recurring administrative expenses such as: payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as GSIS, BIR, PHILHEALTH, LBP, DBP, NPO, PS of the DBM and others, where the authority to approve may be delegated.\nDisbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sanggunian shall be approved by the provincial Vice Governor, the city Vice-Mayor or the municipal Vice-Mayor, as the case may be.\n[17]\nWhile Rep. Act No. 7160 is silent as to the matter, the authority granted to the Vice-Governor to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as to approve disbursement vouchers relating thereto necessarily includes the authority to approve purchase orders covering the same applying the doctrine of necessary implication. This doctrine is explained, thus:\nNo statute can be enacted that can provide all the details involved in its application. There is always an omission that may not meet a particular situation. What is thought, at the time of enactment, to be an all-embracing legislation may be inadequate to provide for the unfolding of events of the future.

Hence, it behooves the Court to resolve whether the Governor has the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nWe hold that the Governor, with respect to the appointment of the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has no such authority.\nAmong the powers granted to the Governor under Section 465 of Rep. Act No. 7160 are:\nSec. 465.\nThe Chief Executive: Powers, Duties, Functions and Compensation.\n– (a) The provincial governor, as the chief executive of the provincial government, shall exercise such powers and perform such duties and functions as provided by this Code and other laws.\n(b) For efficient, effective and economical governance the purpose of which is the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of this Code, the provincial governor shall:\n...\n(v) Appoint all officials and employees whose salaries and wages are wholly or mainly paid out of provincial funds and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in this Code, as well as those he may be authorized by law to appoint.\nOn the other hand, Section 466 vests on the Vice-Governor the power to, among others:\n(2) Subject to civil service law, rules and regulations, appoint all officials and employees of the sangguniang panlalawigan, except those whose manner of appointment is specifically provided in this Code.\nThus, while the Governor has the authority to appoint officials and employees whose salaries are paid out of the provincial funds, this does not extend to the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan because such authority is lodged with the Vice-Governor. In the same manner, the authority to appoint casual and job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan belongs to the Vice-Governor.\nThe authority of the Vice-Governor to appoint the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is anchored on the fact that the salaries of these employees are derived from the appropriation specifically for the said local legislative body. Indeed, the budget source of their salaries is what sets the employees and officials of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan apart from the other employees and officials of the province. Accordingly, the appointing power of the Vice-Governor is limited to those employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, as well as those of the Office of the Vice-Governor, whose salaries are paid out of the funds appropriated for the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. As a corollary, if the salary of an employee or official is charged against the provincial funds, even if this employee reports to the Vice-Governor or is assigned to his office, the Governor retains the authority to appoint the said employee pursuant to Section 465(b)(v) of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nHowever, in this case, it does not appear whether the contractual/job order employees, whose appointments were terminated or cancelled by the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 issued by the respondent Governor, were paid out of the provincial funds or the funds of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\nNonetheless, the validity of the said memorandum cannot be upheld because it absolutely prohibited the respondent Vice-Governor from exercising his authority to appoint the employees, whether regular or contractual/job order, of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and restricted such authority to one of recommendatory nature only.\n[26]\nThis clearly constituted an encroachment on the appointment power of the respondent Vice-Governor under Section 466(a)(2) of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nAt this juncture, it is well to note that under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, the Local Government Code prior to Rep.

Act. No. 7160, therefore, is to vest on the Sangguniang Panlalawigan independence in the exercise of its legislative functions vis-a-vis the discharge by the Governor of the executive functions. The Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 of the respondent Governor, which effectively excluded the petitioner Vice-Governor, the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, from signing the purchase orders for the procurement of supplies, materials or equipment needed for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as from appointing its casual and job order employees, constituted undue interference with the latter's functions. The assailed memoranda are clearly not in keeping with the intent of Rep. Act No. 7160 and their implementation should thus be permanently enjoined.\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED\n. The Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 issued by respondent Governor Jose T. Villarosa are NULL AND VOID\n.\nSO ORDERED.", "facts": "the fact that [Secs.] 466 and 468, RA 7160 already provides for the separation of powers between the executive and legislative. Such authority even include everything necessary for the legislative research program of the Sanggunian.\n[3]\nUnimpressed, the respondent Governor issued the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 relating to the \"TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF SERVICES OF CASUAL/JOB ORDER EMPLOYEES AND REAPPOINTMENT OF THE RESPECTIVE RECOMMENDEES.\" The said memorandum reads:\nFor faithful and appropriate enforcement and execution of laws and issuances and to promote efficiency in the government service, effective immediately, all existing contract of employment – casual/job order basis and reappointment of the recommendees – entered into by Vice-Governor Ramon M. Atienza are hereby terminated for being unauthorized.\nAside from being signed by the unauthorized signatory, the following facts regarding the appointments were considered:\nThe appointment of 28 clerks – on top of existing permanent employees – is a clear manifestation of an excessive and bloated bureaucracy; The appointment of an X-ray Technician detailed at the Provincial Health Office and some clerks detailed at various offices in the province were not proper to be assigned by the Vice-Governor; The appointment of 30 messengers, utility workers and drivers ran counter to COA Opinion as cited in the letter of the undersigned dated 28 June 2002, addressed to the Vice-Governor.\nHowever, in order to accommodate the Vice-Governor and the members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, the undersigned, in his capacity as the local chief executive of the province, will allow four (4) casual/job order employees to be assigned to the Vice-Governor and one (1) casual/job order employee to be assigned to each member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\nThe Vice-Governor and all the Sanggunian Members are hereby directed to submit immediately the names of their recommendees to the undersigned for immediate approval of their respective appointments.\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n[4]\nOn July 3, 2002, the respondent Governor issued another Memorandum regarding the \"ENFORCIBILITY (sic) OF PREVIOUS MEMORANDA ISSUED ON JUNE 20, 26 AND JULY 1, 2002.\" It provides that:\nPlease be properly advised that the Memoranda dated June 20, 26 and July 1, 2002 issued by the undersigned regarding the issuance of permit to travel and authority to sign Purchase Orders of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, is to be strictly adhered to for compliance.\nLikewise for strict compliance is the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 with reference to the Cancellation of the Appointment of Casual/Job Order Employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members/Office of the Vice-Governor previously signed by Vice-Governor Ramon M. Atienza.\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n[5]\nIn his Letter dated July 9, 2002, the petitioner Vice-Governor invoked the principle of separation of powers as applied to the local government units, i.e., the respondent, as the Governor, the head of the executive branch, and the petitioner, as the Vice-Governor, the head of the legislative branch, which is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor reiterated his request for the respondent to make a \"deeper study\" on the matter before implementing his memoranda. The request, however, went unheeded as the respondent Governor insisted on obliging the department heads of the provincial government to comply with the memoranda.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor thus filed with the Court of Appeals the petition for prohibition assailing as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion the respondent Governor's Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002. The petitioner Vice-Governor claimed that these memoranda excluded him from the use and enjoyment of his office in violation of the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, and its implementing rules and regulations. It was prayed that the respondent Governor be enjoined from implementing the assailed memoranda.\nThe appellate court, in its Decision dated November 28, 2003, dismissed the petition for prohibition. Citing Section 344\n[6]\nof Rep. Act No. 7160, the CA upheld the authority of the respondent Governor to issue the Memorandum dated June 25, 2002 as it recognized his authority to approve the purchase orders. The said provision provides in part that \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\"\nThe CA explained that Section 466(a)(1)\n[7]\nof the same Code, relied upon by the petitioner Vice-Governor, speaks of the authority of the Vice-Governor to sign \"all warrants drawn on the public treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n\" In declaring this provision inapplicable, the CA reasoned that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the public treasury.\nSection 361\n[8]\nwas, likewise, held to be inapplicable ratiocinating, thus:\n[R]equisitioning, which is provided under Section 361 of RA 7160, is the act of requiring that something be furnished. In the procurement function, it is the submission of written requests for supplies and materials and the like. It could be inferred that, in the scheme of things, approval of purchase requests is different from approval of purchase orders. Thus, the inapplicability of Section 361.\nAnent the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002, the CA ruled that", "issues": "the issue on whether it could be enjoined had already been rendered moot and academic. The CA pointed out that the subject of the said memorandum could no longer be enjoined or restrained as the termination of the employees had already been effected. It opined that where the act sought to be enjoined in the prohibition proceedings had already been performed and there is nothing more to restrain, the case is already moot and academic.\nThe petitioner Vice-Governor now seeks recourse to this Court alleging that the appellate court committed reversible error in ruling that it is the Governor, and not the Vice-Governor, who has the authority to sign purchase orders of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n. The petitioner Vice-Governor, likewise, takes exception to the holding of the CA that the issue relating to the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had been rendered moot and academic. He points out that the appointment of casual/job order employees is exercised by the appointing authority every six months in the case of casual employees and per job order as to job order employees. Thus, while the July 1, 2002 Memorandum had already been implemented, what is being sought to be enjoined is the respondent Governor's continued usurpation of the petitioner Vice-Governor's authority to appoint the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan under the pertinent provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\nFor his part, the respondent Governor maintains that his Memoranda dated June 25, 2002 and July 1, 2002 are valid\n.\nHe asserts that the approval of purchase orders is different from the power of the Vice-Governor to sign warrants drawn against the provincial treasury under Section 466(a)(1) of Rep. Act No. 7160. Rather, he insists on the application of the last clause in Section 344 which states that the approval of the disbursement by the local chief executive is required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nThe respondent Governor likewise defends the validity of the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 stating that it was issued upon finding that the petitioner Vice-Governor appointed, among others, 28 clerks on top of the existing permanent employees resulting in an excessive and bloated bureaucracy. He concedes the appointing power of the Vice-Governor but submits that this is limited to the employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and that he is not authorized to appoint officials and employees of the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nAs correctly presented by the appellate court, the issues for resolution in this case are:\nA. Who between the petitioner and the respondent is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan?\nB. Does respondent Villarosa, as local chief executive, have the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members and the Office of the Vice-Governor?\n[9]\nBefore resolving the foregoing issues, it is noted that petitioner Atienza and respondent Villarosa had ceased to be the Vice-Governor and Governor, respectively, of the Province of Occidental Mindoro effective June 30, 2004 when the newly-elected officials of the province took their oaths of offices. The petitioner Vice-Governor did not run for re-election during the May 2004 elections while the respondent Governor did not succeed in his re-election bid\n.\nThe expiration of their terms of offices has effectively rendered the case moot. However, even in cases where supervening events had made the cases moot, the Court did not hesitate to resolve the legal or constitutional issues raised to formulate controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and the public.\n[10]\nIn this case, there is compelling reason for the Court to resolve the issues presented in order to clarify the scope of the respective powers of the Governor and Vice-Governor under the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991.\nTo resolve the substantive issues presented in the instant case, it is well to recall that Rep. Act No. 7160 was enacted to give flesh to the constitutional mandate to \"provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanism of recall, initiative and referendum, allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.\"\n[11]\nIn this connection, the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160 are anchored on principles that give effect to decentralization. Among these principles are: [t]here shall be an effective allocation among the different local government units of their respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and resources; [t]here shall be established in every local government unit an accountable, efficient, and dynamic organizational structure and operating mechanism that will meet the priority needs and service requirements of its communities; [p]rovinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions; and [e]ffective mechanisms for ensuring the accountability of local government units to their respective constituents shall be strengthened in order to upgrade continually the quality of local leadership.\n[12]\nWith these guideposts, the Court shall now address the issue on who between the Governor and Vice-Governor is authorized to approve purchase orders issued in connection with the procurement of supplies, materials, equipment, including fuel, repairs and maintenance of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nWe hold that it is the Vice-Governor who has such authority.\nUnder Rep. Act No. 7160, local legislative power for the province is exercised by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n[13]\nand the Vice-Governor is its presiding officer.\n[14]\nBeing vested with legislative powers, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan enacts ordinances, resolutions and appropriates funds for the general welfare of the province in accordance with the provisions of Rep. Act No. 7160.\n[15]\nThe same statute vests upon the Vice-Governor the power to:\n(1) Be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan and sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the sangguniang panlalawigan.\n[16]\nFurther, Section 344 provides:\nSec. 344.\nCertification on, and Approval of, Vouchers.\n– No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose. Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to validity, propriety and legality of the claim involved. Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses such as payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as the GSIS, SSS, LBP, DBP, National Printing Office, Procurement Service of the DBM and others, approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.\nIn cases of special or trust funds, disbursements shall be approved by the administrator of the fund.\nIn case of temporary absence or incapacity of the department head or chief of office, the officer next-in-rank shall automatically perform his function and he shall be fully responsible therefor.\nReliance by the CA on the clause \"approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed\" of the above section (Section 344) to rule that it is the Governor who has the authority to approve purchase orders for the supplies, materials or equipment for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is misplaced. This clause cannot prevail over the more specific clause of the same provision which provides that \"vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned.\" The Vice-Governor, as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has administrative control of the funds of the said body. Accordingly, it is the Vice-Governor who has the authority to approve disbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nOn this point, Section 39 of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System for Local Government Units, prepared by the Commission on Audit (COA), is instructive:\nSec. 39.\nApproval of Disbursements.\n– Approval of disbursements by the Local Chief Executive (LCE) himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed, except for regularly recurring administrative expenses such as: payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as GSIS, BIR, PHILHEALTH, LBP, DBP, NPO, PS of the DBM and others, where the authority to approve may be delegated.\nDisbursement vouchers for expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sanggunian shall be approved by the provincial Vice Governor, the city Vice-Mayor or the municipal Vice-Mayor, as the case may be.\n[17]\nWhile Rep. Act No. 7160 is silent as to the matter, the authority granted to the Vice-Governor to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as to approve disbursement vouchers relating thereto necessarily includes the authority to approve purchase orders covering the same applying the doctrine of necessary implication. This doctrine is explained, thus:\nNo statute can be enacted that can provide all the details involved in its application. There is always an omission that may not meet a particular situation. What is thought, at the time of enactment, to be an all-embracing legislation may be inadequate to provide for the unfolding of events of the future. So-called gaps in the law develop as the law is enforced. One of the rules of statutory construction used to fill in the gap is the doctrine of necessary implication. The doctrine states that what is implied in a statute is as much a part thereof as that which is expressed. Every statute is understood, by implication, to contain all such provisions as may be necessary to effectuate its object and purpose, or to make effective rights, powers, privileges or jurisdiction which it grants, including all such collateral and subsidiary consequences as may be fairly and logically inferred from its terms.\nEx necessitate legis.\nAnd every statutory grant of power, right or privilege is deemed to include all incidental power, right or privilege. This is so because the greater includes the lesser, expressed in the maxim, in eo plus sit, simper inest et minus.\n[18]\nWarrants are \"order[s] directing the treasurer of the municipality to pay money out of funds in city treasury which are or may become available for purpose specified to designated person[s].\"\n[19]\nWarrants of a municipal corporation are generally orders payable when funds are found. They are issued for the payment of general municipal debts and expenses subject to the rule that they shall be paid in the order of presentation.\n[20]\nThe ordinary meaning of \"voucher\" is a document which shows that services have been performed or expenses incurred. It covers any acquittance or receipt discharging the person or evidencing payment by him. When used in connection with disbursement of money, it implies some instrument that shows on what account or by what authority a particular payment has been made, or that services have been performed which entitle the party to whom it is issued to payment.\n[21]\nPurchase order, on the other hand, is \"an authorization by the issuing party for the recipient to provide materials or services for which issuing party agrees to pay; it is an offer to buy which becomes binding when those things ordered have been provided.\"\n[22]\nWhen an authorized person approves a disbursement voucher, he certifies to the correctness of the entries therein, among others: that the expenses incurred were necessary and lawful, the supporting documents are complete and the availability of cash therefor. Further, the person who performed the services or delivered the supplies, materials or equipment is entitled to payment.\n[23]\nOn the other hand, the terms and conditions for the procurement of supplies, materials or equipment, in particular, are contained in a purchase order. The tenor of a purchase order basically directs the supplier to deliver the articles enumerated and subject to the terms and conditions specified therein.\n[24]\nHence, the express authority to approve disbursement vouchers and, in effect, authorize the payment of money claims for supplies, materials or equipment, necessarily includes the authority to approve purchase orders to cause the delivery of the said supplies, materials or equipment.\nSince it is the Vice-Governor who approves disbursement vouchers and approves the payment for the procurement of the supplies, materials and equipment needed for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, then he also has the authority to approve the purchase orders to cause the delivery of the said supplies, materials or equipment.\nIndeed, the authority granted to the Vice-Governor to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial treasury for all expenditures appropriated for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as well as to approve disbursement vouchers relating thereto is greater and includes the authority to approve purchase orders for the procurement of the supplies, materials and equipment necessary for the operation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n.\nAnent the second issue, the appellate court likewise committed reversible error in holding that the implementation of the Memorandum dated July 1, 2002 had rendered the petition moot and academic. It is recognized that courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is \"capable of repetition yet evading review.\"\n[25]\nEven if the employees whose contractual or job order employment had been terminated by the implementation of the July 1, 2002 Memorandum may no longer be reinstated, still, similar memoranda may be issued by other local chief executives. Hence, it behooves the Court to resolve whether the Governor has the authority to terminate or cancel the appointments of casual/job order employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the Office of the Vice-Governor.\nWe hold that the Governor, with respect to the appointment of the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan\n, has no such authority.\nAmong the powers granted to the Governor under Section 465 of Rep. Act No. 7160 are:\nSec. 465.\nThe Chief Executive: Powers, Duties, Functions and Compensation.\n– (a) The provincial governor, as the chief executive of the provincial government, shall exercise such powers and perform such duties and functions as provided by this Code and other laws.\n(b) For efficient, effective and economical governance the purpose of which is the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of this Code, the provincial governor shall:\n...\n(v) Appoint all officials and employees whose salaries and wages are wholly or mainly paid out of provincial funds and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in this Code, as well as those he may be authorized by law to appoint.\nOn the other hand, Section 466 vests on the Vice-Governor the power to, among others:\n(2) Subject to civil service law, rules and regulations, appoint all officials and employees of the sangguniang panlalawigan, except those whose manner of appointment is specifically provided in this Code.\nThus, while the Governor has the authority to appoint officials and employees whose salaries are paid out of the provincial funds, this does not extend to the officials and employees of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan because such authority is lodged with the Vice-Governor.

NO. 159556, May 26, 2005 ]\nPHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., PETITIONER-MOVANT, VS. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND ALENDRY DE LEON, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N CALLEJO, SR., J.:\nBefore the Court is the petition for review on certiorari filed by Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL) seeking the reversal of the Decision\n[1]\ndated April 25, 2003 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 63398. The assailed decision, reversing that of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), found the petitioner liable for unlawfully terminating the employment of respondent Alendry de Leon. Likewise sought to be reversed and set aside is the appellate court's Resolution dated August 18, 2003 denying the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\nThe factual backdrop of the case is as follows:\nOn September 15, 1995, the petitioner received a copy of the complaint of Cesar Villanueva addressed to the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation. Villanueva alleged therein that he purchased a round trip ticket for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo flight route. He further averred that he took PAL flight PR 140 bound for Manila on August 22, 1995. Instead of taking the return flight to Iloilo, however, Villanueva decided to take the boat. Subsequently, he went to the PAL office in Iloilo to request for a refund of his unused Manila-Iloilo ticket. To his consternation, he was told that his ticket did not show that he took the PR 140 (Iloilo-Manila) flight on August 22, 1995 and neither did his name appear in the passenger boarding manifest for the said flight. Upon further verification, it was discovered that another person had collected the refund of his Manila-Iloilo ticket.\nVillanueva's complaint triggered an investigation conducted by the petitioner through its internal audit. The initial findings showed that PAL Ticket No. 079 2420943398 was issued to Villanueva for the Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. He was originally booked on PAL flight PR 140 for Iloilo-Manila on August 22, 1995. Villanueva actually took that flight and surrendered the Iloilo-Manila coupon of his ticket to the petitioner's check-in counter in Iloilo. The Check-in Clerks then on duty were Perseus Dinglasa and Claude Corpuz while the Load Control Clerk was Arturo Garrido.\nGenerally, a Check-in Clerk is tasked to receive the tickets of passengers and issue to them their respective boarding passes corresponding to their flights. Upon receipt of the ticket, the Check-in Clerk is required to indicate thereon the passenger's boarding sequence number\n[2]\nand seat number and baggage information. The Check-in Clerk is also required to put his or her initials on the ticket. These checked-in tickets are to be turned over by the Check-in Clerk to the Load Control Clerk who shall log or list the passengers' names in the passenger boarding manifest or flight manifest. The Load Control Clerk shall, thereafter, invalidate these checked-in tickets by perforating or punching two holes on the lower right hand corner of each ticket.\nHowever, with respect to Villanueva's ticket, which was surrendered to Check-in Clerks Dinglasa and Corpuz, it did not bear any boarding sequence number, seat number or baggage information. Neither did it bear the initials of Dinglasa or Corpuz. Worse, Villanueva's name did not appear in the flight manifest prepared by Garrido. It appeared that Villanueva's checked-in ticket was not invalidated by Garrido as it did not bear any perforation or punched holes.\nThe investigation further showed that Villanueva's PAL Ticket No. 079 2420943398 was cancelled and in lieu thereof PAL Ticket No. 079 2420946097 was issued in his name, this time for the Bacolod-Manila route initially with an open date. The new ticket was issued by Ticket Freight Clerk Roberto Dinson. Thereafter, it was received by respondent Alendry De Leon, also a Ticket Freight Clerk, who affixed revalidation sticker No. 11277306 thereon showing booking on PAL flight PR 134 (Bacolod-Manila) on August 30, 1995. Subsequently, payment for the refund of Villanueva's new ticket was made by Dinson.\nTicket Freight Clerks are, among other tasks, responsible for issuing revalidation stickers in cases of rebookings and cancellations by passengers of their flight reservations. They are also authorized to refund tickets to bona fide refund applicants. In the refund of tickets, the Ticket Freight Clerks are required to observe certain procedural safeguards to ensure that the person requesting for the refund is the same person whose name appears in the ticket. Ticket Freight Clerks are thus required to: verify the identity of the person requesting and receiving the refund; note down the identification documents presented therefor; require the person receiving the refund to affix his or her signature on the sticker; and have a responsible officer countersign the ticket.\nUpon finding that irregularities attended the refund of Villanueva's ticket, the petitioner conducted a more thorough investigation on the other tickets that had been refunded in its Iloilo Airport Ticket Office for the period of July to September 1995. The petitioner's auditors were able to contact those passengers who purportedly had their tickets refunded. These passengers confirmed that they actually took their flights but, upon verification, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest of their respective flights. Further, they did not ask for the refund of their tickets. Some even turned over the passenger coupons of their flown or used tickets or boarding passes to prove that they took their flights. More than sixty (60) passengers executed affidavits and/or certificates attesting that they actually took their respective flights and that they did not request for any refund of their used or flown tickets nor cancelled their bookings.\nThe petitioner then formed a Special Committee to look into the anomalous transactions. The modus operandi was outlined, thus:\nUpon presentation by the passenger of his ticket to the Check-in Clerk, the Check-in Clerk issues a Boarding Pass. Without indicating the passenger's sequence number, seat number, baggage information, nor his initial, the Check-in Clerk forwards the flight ticket coupon to the Load Control Clerk for posting/listing of the name of the passenger in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest; The Load Control Clerk instead of posting/listing the needed data in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest forwards the flight ticket coupon (\nwithout invalidating/perforating it\n) to Ticket Freight Clerks/Check-in Clerks where the surrendered flight ticket coupon is either:\nRerouted, reissued or \"in-lieued\" to another sector; Revalidated to make it appear that the passenger backed out; Revalidated to open status.\nThe above-mentioned activities of the Ticket Freight Clerks and Check-in Clerks after the flight ticket coupons are handed to them by [the] Load Control Clerk allow them to refund the same without arousing suspicion from the Station and Accounting Department. There are instances specially in cases of full flights where full fare coupons were even substituted with child fare (half fare) tickets issued to fictitious persons or non-revenue tickets (trip pass) of their dependents to ensure that the passenger whose ticket they intend to refund is assured a seat and would not be bumped off to prevent early detection of this malevolent scheme.\n[3]\nFrom the foregoing, it was deduced that the scheme could only have been effected by the employees of the petitioner themselves and by not just one but several of them acting in concert. The investigation showed that the fraudulent refunds were perpetrated by the following employees:\nMr. Perseus Dinglasa Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Claude Corpuz Clerk Porter/Check-In Clerk Mr. Nestor Resma Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Arturo Garrido Load Control Clerk Mr. Alendry de Leon Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Jeffrey de Toro Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Roberto Dinson Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Rogelio Manar Ticket Freight Clerk These eight employees were all assigned at the petitioner's Iloilo Airport Ticket Office. It appeared that the anomalous transactions occurred whenever these employees were on duty and that the fraudulently refunded tickets passed through their hands for processing.\nConsequently, administrative charges were filed against them for \"Fraud against the Company, Falsification of Company Documents and Failure on the Job.\" Each of the eight employees was furnished with their respective notices of the administrative charges against them. The notices uniformly read:\nThe results of the fact-finding committee confirms (sic) your involvement in a concerted action to defraud the company of its rightful revenues by your deliberate participation in the mishandling of; lifted coupons of passengers later verified to have used/flown their tickets; resulting to passenger not being manifested on his flight; and/or substitution of the tickets of these passengers with child fare tickets; and/or issuance of fictitious child fare tickets to be used in the aforementioned substitution; and/or entering false information in the lifted tickets by affixing revalidation stickers as a spurious assumption of backing out from a flight; and/or in-lieuing of lifted flight coupons to same or different routing; and ultimately refunding of the tampered tickets; and/or improper use of space accommodation.\nBe advised therefore that after due consideration and evaluation of the fact-finding committee of the evidence on hand and circumstances pertinent thereto, there appears a probable cause to administratively charge you for the offense of:\nA. FRAUD – under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 57 as defined as follows:\nFRAUD AGAINST THE COMPANY Any employee who deliberately or negligently makes a false presentation of facts or any kind of deception, or a false or fraudulent claim against the company; or knowingly or with gross negligence, initiates or takes part in any action intended to defraud the company or to obtain a payment, benefit or gain from the company to which he or [a] third party is not entitled, or knowingly honors a forged signature for his own benefit or that of another person; or accepts, submits or gives due course or approval to a document knowing it to be false or erroneous, under or overvalued, shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nB. FALSIFICATION OF COMPANY DOCUMENTS under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 60, as defined as follows:\nFALSIFICATION Falsification of a company document or the use of a falsified document or false information is a serious misconduct. Any employee who, shall falsify, conceal or fabricate company documents or records, or enters false information on any official company document shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nActs of falsification include not only tampering with or altering documents or records, but also that of representing falsely or distorting, or violating the truth.\nC. FAILURE ON THE JOB under Chapter II, Sec. 2, Art. 25 defined as follows:\nFAILURE ON THE JOB Any employee who demonstrates his refusal or inability without justifiable reasons or cause to perform the duties and responsibilities on his job and to accomplish the performance and productivity standards thereof shall be meted the penalty AS PRESCRIBED IN THE SCHEDULE OF PENALTIES UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THIS CODE, depending upon the gravity and/or frequency of the offense and whether the evidence shows the situation to be temporary and remediable or permanent and incurable. WHERE SUCH ACT OR ACTS AMOUNT TO ANY OF THE JUST CAUSES FOR TERMINATION UNDER ARTICLE 282 OF THE LABOR CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES, THE PENALTY SHALL BE DISMISSAL.\nYour particular participation in this conspiracy to defraud the company and other violations so mentioned are summarized in the attached schedule under \"responsible employee.\"\nThe foregoing charges constitute grave abuse of trust and confidence reposed upon you by the company, which are sufficient grounds for your dismissal from employment not only under [the] Code of Discipline but also under the Labor Code as amended, without prejudice to the company filing a criminal complaint.\nYou are given ten (10) calendar days from receipt of this notice within which to answer the charge/s contained herein. You may submit your sworn written answer or counter-affidavit with sworn statements of your witness, if any, and other supporting documents.\nSince it appears that your continued employment poses a serious and eminent threat to the interests of the company you are hereby placed on preventive suspension for thirty (30) days immediately upon receipt of this notice.\n[4]\nAs indicated in the notices, the said employees were given ten (10) days to submit their respective sworn written answers to the charges against them. Clarificatory hearings were conducted by the petitioner's Administrative Investigating Panel where the said employees appeared with their respective counsels. Thereafter, the panel submitted its report and recommendation finding the eight employees guilty of the charges against them. Accordingly, the petitioner meted the penalty of dismissal on these employees. It furnished them their respective notices of dismissal stating therein the reasons and grounds therefor.\n[5]\nForthwith, Roberto Dinson, Rogelio Manar, Alendry De Leon (respondent herein), Jeffrey De Toro, Arturo Garrido and Perseus Dinglasa filed their respective complaints for illegal dismissal against the petitioner docketed as NLRC SRAB VI Case Nos. 06-12-50415-95, 06-02-50133-96, 06-12-50416-95, 06-02-50135-96, 06-02-50136-96, 06-02-50142-96 and 06-02-50145-96, respectively. Dinglasa's complaint, however, was dismissed without prejudice to its re-filing because he did not sign his complaint and its verification. Only his attorney-in-fact signed the same.\nThe cases were consolidated and jointly tried. The Labor Arbiter conducted a full-blown trial where the petitioner presented three\n[6]\nof its employees who described the procedure the ticket undergoes in the normal course from when the passenger buys it to when it is used with the passenger actually boarding his or her flight. They also explained the scheme employed by the dismissed employees to fraudulently refund the used or flown tickets. Three passengers\n[7]\nalso took the witness stand and testified that while they actually took their scheduled flights, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. These passengers asserted that they did not by themselves, nor did they authorize other persons to, ask for the refund of their tickets. In addition, the petitioner presented in evidence over a hundred documents consisting of, among others, affidavits\n[8]\nor certifications\n[9]\nof passengers who invariably made similar allegations. Also submitted as evidence for the petitioner were the tickets involved in the anomalous transactions.\nFor their part, Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido, Dinglasa and respondent De Leon, as complainants, testified and likewise submitted their respective documentary evidence. They denied any involvement in the anomalous transactions involving the refund of flown or used tickets. They maintained that no irregularity attended the performance of their respective functions. They claimed that the petitioner did not afford them procedural due process.\nAfter due proceedings, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment dismissing the complaints for illegal dismissal. It was held that the petitioner was able to establish by substantial evidence that there was valid and just cause to terminate the employment of the complainants. According to the Labor Arbiter, the testimonies of the three passengers, as well as the affidavits of the other passengers similarly situated, were more than enough evidence to convince an unbiased person that used or flown tickets had indeed been fraudulently refunded. As a result, the petitioner had been deprived of its rightful revenues.\nThe Labor Arbiter found that the used or flown tickets that had been fraudulently refunded were for the flights when Garrido, as the Load Control Clerk, was on duty. For example, the tickets of the passengers who testified during the hearings were turned over to Garrido and contrary to what was required of him, he did not enter their names in the passenger boarding manifest for the said flights. These tickets were later fraudulently refunded. Over a hundred tickets were later discovered to have been similarly fraudulently refunded.\nThe Labor Arbiter further made the finding that Garrido could not have acted alone because he could not cause the tickets to be refunded by himself. Ticket Freight Clerks Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, whose duties included the refunding of tickets, were thus held to have acted in concert with Garrido. Specifically, they participated in the scheme by re-routing and affixing revalidation stickers on the tickets to make it appear that the passengers backed out of their flights and had their new tickets rerouted with open dates. Subsequently, the new tickets were refunded. Other schemes resorted to by these Ticket Freight Clerks included substituting \"adult fare\" tickets, which are charged the full fare, with \"child fare\" tickets, which are charged only half the fare. The \"adult fare\" tickets were then refunded. There were instances also when tickets of paying passengers were replaced with non-revenue tickets (trip passes given to dependents of the petitioner's employees) and the former were then refunded.\nIn finding them to have acted in concert to defraud the petitioner, the Labor Arbiter opined:\nIf there was no connections [\nsic\n] between Garrido on the one hand and Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, there was no way the used tickets would have been refunded.\nIt would be taxing our imagination to absurd limits to make us believe that strangers got hold of these used tickets and complainants Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro so extra gullible that they were not able to detect hundreds of used tickets which strangers presented to them for \"in-lieuing,\" re-routing, revalidating, rescheduling, etc\n. If these were an isolated case then it can be said that human lapses were to blame. When hundreds of tickets are involved, human lapses as an excuse become lame and unbelievable.\nComplainants who are Check-in/Freight Clerks contend that the Cashier and Station Head could have detected then and there the said anomaly since they signed the verification, and certified the same as correct the Daily Sales Report submitted by complainants. This does not exculpate complainants from their actions which were later found to be anomalous. At most, the Cashier and the Station Head were negligent in the performance of their duties but complainants are still liable for their anomalous refunds.\n[10]\nThe claim of denial of due process was, likewise, given scant consideration as the Labor Arbiter declared that the dismissed employees were given ample opportunity to present their side. Accordingly, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaints as he declared that the petitioner was justified in terminating the employment of Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido and respondent De Leon.\nThe dismissed employees then elevated the case to the NLRC. Their appeal was docketed as NLRC Case No. V-000583-98. In the Decision dated June 30, 2000, the NLRC denied the appeal as it affirmed in toto the findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter.\nRefuting the dismissed employees' contention that conspiracy had not been established, the NLRC expounded that \"conspiracy\" should not be given its technical meaning in criminal law. Rather, it is sufficient for purposes of labor proceedings that it had been established by substantial evidence consisting of the testimonies of the passengers and other documentary evidence that the appellants participated in the realization of the fraudulent refund of tickets.\nOnly respondent De Leon filed with the CA a petition for certiorari imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in rendering the decision which affirmed that of the Labor Arbiter.\nIn the assailed Decision dated April 25, 2003, the appellate court reversed the decision of the NLRC with respect to respondent De Leon. The CA held that there was no sufficient evidence to establish that respondent De Leon conspired with the other employees in fraudulently refunding the used or flown tickets. The CA explained that the fact that respondent De Leon \"changed, re-routed or re-issued\" four tickets and \"affixed revalidation stickers\" on three tickets which were later fraudulently refunded does not automatically establish that these were done by him for the purpose of defrauding the petitioner of its revenues and as part of the alleged conspiracy against PAL.\nThe CA ratiocinated, thus:\n[I]t was possible that petitioner [respondent De Leon] was not aware that the tickets which were brought to him for \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" were already used or flown. As Ticket Freight Clerk, \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" are part of the usual and normal functions of petitioner's nature of work. The latter had no reason to suspect that the tickets brought to him were already used or flown since under normal procedures, used or flown tickets should not even be brought to his office in the first place, but should have been posted by the Load Control Clerk. Under the circumstances, it is only the Load Control Clerk which could be attributed with the knowledge that the tickets were already used, but not the Ticket Freight Clerk.\nThe fact that the tickets have \"check-in markings\" on them could not be taken against petitioner since the tickets were not perforated. When tickets have been flown or used, they are perforated and sent to the Accounting and Auditing Division together with the passenger manifest. Without the perforation, the \"check-in markings\" may not be considered unusual or suspicious, for there are cases when passengers back-out from their flights even after they have already checked-in. In these instances, the tickets are given back with the \"check-in markings.\"\nThe possibility that petitioner might have been taken advantage of by his co-workers, who were responsible for the perpetration of the anomalous transactions, cannot be discounted. This doubt, as to petitioner's participation in the fraudulent scheme against PAL should be resolved in favor of petitioner. In case of doubt, cases should be resolved in favor of labor, pursuant to the social justice policy of our labor laws and the Constitution.\n[11]\nThe CA concluded that the petitioner was not able to discharge its burden of proving that there existed valid and just cause to dismiss respondent De Leon. It thus declared that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that respondent De Leon effected refunds of used or flown tickets in furtherance of the conspiracy to perpetrate fraud against PAL. The dispositive portion of the assailed CA decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, finding merit in the petition, the same is hereby GRANTED and the assailed decision of the NLRC is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.\nFinding petitioner's dismissal from employment to be illegal, private respondent PAL is hereby ordered to reinstate petitioner to his former position, without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, or in lieu of reinstatement, if the same is no longer possible, to pay petitioner a separation pay equivalent to one (1) month's salary for every year of service rendered by the latter. Private respondent PAL is likewise ordered to pay backwages in favor of petitioner from the time the latter was illegally dismissed until his reinstatement, or until the finality of this decision, in case reinstatement is no longer possible.\nSO ORDERED.\n[12]\nThe petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the appellate court's decision but its motion was denied in the assailed Resolution dated August 18, 2003. Hence, its recourse to this Court.\nThe petitioner proffers the following reasons for the allowance of its petition for review on certiorari:\n-I-\nTHE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS CONTRARY TO THE WELL-SETTLED DOCTRINE THAT FACTUAL FINDINGS OF LABOR OFFICIALS WHEN SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ARE NOT TO BE DISTURBED. THEY MUST BE ACCORDED NOT ONLY RESPECT BUT FINALITY.\n-II-\nTHE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS CONTRARY TO THE EXPRESS PROVISION OF THE LABOR CODE THAT IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND THE LABOR ARBITERS, THE RULES OF EVIDENCE PREVAILING IN COURTS OF LAW OR EQUITY SHALL NOT BE CONTROLLING. THEY SHALL USE EVERY AND ALL REASONABLE MEANS TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS IN EACH CASE SPEEDILY AND OBJECTIVELY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO TECHNICALITIES OF LAW OR PROCEDURE.\n-III-\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMPLETELY MISAPPRECIATED EXTANT EVIDENCE AND THUS, SERIOUSLY ERRED IN DECLARING THE DISMISSAL OF RESPONDENT ALENDRY DE LEON ILLEGAL ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE –\n(a) THE ACT OF CHANGING, RE-ROUTING OR RE-ISSUING OF FOUR (4) TICKETS AND AFFIXING REVALIDATION STICKERS TO THREE (3) OTHER TICKETS BY THE PETITIONER \"DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY ESTABLISH THAT THE SAME WERE DONE XXX FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAUDING PAL OF ITS REVENUES AND AS PART OF THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY AGAINST PAL\" SINCE THEY WERE ISOLATED AND TRIVIAL ACTS WHICH \"COULD BE DISMISSED AS NEGLIGENCE OR OVERSIGHT.\"\n(b) THE PETITIONER WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE TICKETS WHICH WERE BROUGHT TO HIM FOR \"IN-LIEUING, RE-ROUTING, RE-ISSUING AND AFFIXING VALIDATION STICKERS\" WERE ALREADY USED OR FLOWN AND THAT \"PETITIONER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY HIS CO-WORKERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERPETRATION OF THE ANOMALOUS TRANSACTIONS.\"\n[13]\nThe foregoing grounds relied upon by the petitioner are interrelated and may be subsumed in the basic issue of whether the CA committed reversible error when it set aside the decision of the NLRC and held the petitioner liable for terminating the employment of respondent De Leon.\nIt is well entrenched that when supported by substantial evidence, factual findings made by quasi-judicial and administrative bodies are generally accorded great respect and even finality by the courts.\n[14]\nSubstantial evidence, which is the quantum of evidence required to establish a fact in cases before administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, is that level of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.\n[15]\nAfter a careful review of the records of the case, the Court finds that the findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter with respect to the validity of the dismissal of respondent De Leon and his companions, which the NLRC affirmed in toto\n, are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the CA committed reversible error in setting aside these findings and conclusions of the labor officials.\nThe Court observes that the petitioner has presented ample evidence showing respondent De Leon's involvement in the anomalous transactions of refunding used or flown tickets. His involvement has been shown particularly in the instances of fraudulent refund of tickets of the following passengers:\nDaisy Divinagracia and Mark Barretto They surrendered their tickets to Check-in Clerks Dinglasa and Resma when they checked in for their Iloilo-Manila flight on August 17, 1995. Without indicating thereon the necessary information, Dinglasa and Resma turned over the tickets to Load Control Clerk Garrido who, contrary to the standard procedure, did not invalidate the tickets. Neither did Garrido enter the names of Divinagracia and Barretto in the passenger boarding manifest of flight PR 148 on August 17, 1995 despite the fact that they actually boarded said flight. The tickets of Divinagracia and Barretto were forwarded to Ticket Freight Clerk Manar, who endorsed them to respondent De Leon, also a Ticket Freight Clerk.\nIn lieu of these tickets, respondent De Leon issued new tickets in the names of Divinagracia and Barretto for the Roxas City-Manila route with open dates despite the fact that no such request was made by these passengers because they actually took their original flights.\n[16]\nThese new tickets issued by respondent De Leon were subsequently refunded\n.\n[17]\nIn her affidavit, [18]\nDivinagracia attested that she bought the tickets for herself and her relatives Mark and Lito Barretto for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. They were booked on flight PR 148 on August 17, 1995. They actually took the said flight but later discovered that their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. She further averred that neither she nor Mark requested for the rerouting of their tickets. They did not, likewise, ask for the refund of the same. Moreover, the signatures appearing on the refunded tickets were not their signatures and the contact numbers indicated thereon were not theirs.\nReynaldo Espinal He surrendered his ticket for flight PR 148 on August 8, 1995 to Dinglasa and Resma. His ticket, when turned over to Garrido, was not invalidated. And although his Boarding Sequence Number was 51, Espinal's name did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest of flight PR 148 on the said date. Instead, the name of half-fare or child passenger \"LAYUG, DD, MSTR\" appeared on Boarding Sequence No. 51 thereon.\nIt appeared that a ticket for the Iloilo-Manila (one way) route with an open date was issued to a \"LAYUG, DD, MSTR,\" a child passenger.\nThis half-fare or child ticket, issued by Ticket Freight Clerk Dinson, subsequently reached respondent De Leon, who affixed a revalidation sticker thereon which made it appear that \"LAYUG, DD, MSTR\" was booked on flight PR 148 on August 8, 1995.\n[19]\nThis booking, however, was not recorded in PAL's reservations system. The half-fare or child ticket of LAYUG, DD, MSTR was then used to substitute Espinal's ticket, on which a revalidation sticker showing \"open\" booking was affixed by Ticket Freight Clerk De Toro. In lieu of this ticket, Dinson issued a new ticket in the name of Espinal for the Bacolod-Manila route.\n[20]\nSubsequently, this new ticket was refunded.\n[21]\nIn his affidavit, [22]\nEspinal stated that he purchased a ticket for the petitioner's flight PR 148 for Iloilo-Manila on August 8, 1995. He actually took the said flight but later learned that his name did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. He further declared that he did not cancel his booking on the said flight nor did he ask for the refund of his ticket.\nMa. Lucia and Leticia Mondragon Their tickets were received by Dinglasa and Resma when they checked-in for the PR 140 flight for Iloilo-Manila on August 8, 1995. Ma. Lucia and Leticia Mondragon were assigned Boarding Sequence Nos. 92 and 93, respectively, but Dinglasa and Resma did not write on the tickets the necessary information. When the tickets were turned over to him, Garrido, again, did not invalidate the tickets nor did he log the names of Ma. Lucia and Leticia Mondragon in the passenger boarding manifest. Instead, appearing therein and assigned Boarding Sequence Nos. 92 and 93 were the names of \"SANTOS, MELRIC, MSTR\" and \"TAN, JANJASON, MSTR,\" both half-fare or child passengers.\nThese half-fare or child tickets, issued by Manar, [23]\nwere used to substitute the tickets of Ma. Lucia and Leticia Mondragon. The latter tickets were cancelled and in lieu thereof, new tickets were issued by Dinson in their names for Iloilo-Manila with open booking. Subsequently, Manar and Dinson affixed revalidation stickers on the new tickets of Leticia and Ma. Lucia Mondragon, respectively.\nThe revalidation stickers used by Manar and Dinson were assigned or issued to respondent De Leon.\n[24]\nThe new tickets were later on refunded by Manar.\n[25]\nIn their joint affidavit, [26]\nMa. Lucia and Leticia Mondragon averred that they purchased tickets for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. They were booked on flight PR 140 bound for Manila on August 8, 1995. They took the said flight but, upon verification, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. They categorically denied canceling their original booking or requesting for a refund of their tickets. Moreover, the signatures appearing on the refunded tickets were not theirs.\nVirgilio Dureza When he checked-in for flight PR 140 (Iloilo-Manila) on August 18, 1995, Dureza surrendered his ticket to Dinglasa and Resma who, without indicating thereon the required information, turned over the same to Garrido. Dureza was assigned Boarding Sequence No. 77. Garrido neither invalidated Dureza's ticket nor included his name in the passenger boarding manifest. Instead, the name of half-fare or child passenger \"GALO, EL MSTR\" appeared therein.\nThe half-fare or child ticket for the Iloilo-Manila route, issued by Dinson, was received by respondent De Leon who affixed thereon a revalidation sticker to make it appear that \"GALO, EL MSTR\" was booked on flight PR 140 on August 18, 1995.\n[27]\nSuch booking, however, was not reflected in PAL's reservations system. This half-fare or child ticket was used to substitute Dureza's ticket which was, in turn, received by De Toro who affixed thereon a revalidation sticker.\n[28]\nOn August 21, 1995, in lieu of this ticket, respondent De Leon issued a new ticket in the name of Dureza, this time, for the Manila-Iloilo route with open date\n.\n[29]\nThe following day, this new ticket was refunded by Dinson.\n[30]\nIn his affidavit, [31]\nDureza averred that he purchased the ticket for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. He had a booking for the PR 140 flight on August 18, 1995 and he actually took the said flight. He discovered, however, that his name did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. He denied canceling his original booking or requesting for a refund of his ticket. Further, the signature appearing on the refunded ticket and the address indicated therein were not his.\nAnastacio Villanueva When he checked-in for flight PR 140 (Iloilo-Manila) on August 18, 1995, Villanueva surrendered his ticket to Dinglasa and Resma. Contrary to the standard procedure, Dinglasa and Resma did not indicate on the said ticket his boarding sequence number, seat number and baggage information. They endorsed the ticket to Garrido, who did not invalidate the same. He did not also log Villanueva's name in the passenger boarding manifest of the said flight. Thereafter, Dinson affixed a revalidation sticker on Villanueva's ticket making it appear that he cancelled his booking on PR 140 on August 18, 1995.\n[32]\nIn lieu of this ticket, respondent De Leon issued a new ticket in Villanueva's name for Manila-Iloilo route with open date.\n[33]\nThe new ticket was subsequently refunded by Dinson.\n[34]\nIn his affidavit, [35]\nVillanueva stated that he purchased ticket for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. He had a booking on PR 140 flight on August 18, 1995. He actually boarded the said flight. However, it was subsequently discovered that his name did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. He clarified that he did not cancel his original booking and that he did not request for a refund of his ticket. Also, the signature appearing in the refunded ticket and the address indicated therein were not his.\nTo the Court's mind, the foregoing incidents, culled from the affidavits of the passengers and the documentary evidence, indubitably establish respondent De Leon's involvement in the fraudulent refund of tickets to the petitioner's prejudice. The affidavits of Divinagracia, Espinal, the Mondragons, Dureza and Anastacio Villanueva, even if they did not testify during the hearings before the Labor Arbiter, were properly given evidentiary weight. It is recognized that administrative bodies like the NLRC, including the Labor Arbiter, are not bound by the technical niceties of the law and procedure and the rules obtaining in courts of law.\n[36]\nRules of evidence are not strictly observed in proceedings before administrative bodies like the NLRC, where decisions may be reached on the basis of position papers.\n[37]\nTheir affidavits, taken together with the tickets, confirm respondent De Leon's participation in the scheme by which the used or flown tickets were refunded. As correctly asserted by the petitioner, respondent De Leon's and his companions' culpability cannot be compartmentalized. Each played an important role in the consummation of the fraud.\nRespondent De Leon claims that his acts were routinary and innocent and were made in the performance of his functions. This contention is flimsy. Significantly, he performed these acts of \"in-lieuing,\" rerouting, reissuing and affixing revalidation stickers without the passengers themselves requesting such, because they, in fact, took their flights. Further, all these occurred in the month of August 1995; hence, contrary to the CA's theory, they could not be considered as \"isolated acts\" which \"could be dismissed as negligence or oversight\" on the part of respondent De Leon. Rather, his acts were highly irregular and convincingly demonstrate that he acted in cahoots with the other dismissed employees to perpetrate their scam. In particular, his acts of \"in-lieuing,\" rerouting, reissuing and affixing revalidation stickers facilitated the fraudulent refund of the tickets.\nIn holding that \"PAL was not able to meet its burden of proving [respondent De Leon's] participation in the fraudulent scheme against it\"\n[38]\nand that the NLRC \"abused its discretion in finding that [respondent De Leon] effected refunds of used or flown tickets in furtherance of the conspiracy to perpetrate fraud against PAL,\"\n[39]\nthe CA, in effect, would require direct proof of the conspiracy. The appellate court committed reversible error in so holding.\nEven in criminal law, where the quantum of evidence required is proof beyond reasonable doubt, direct proof is not essential to show conspiracy.\n[40]\nIt may be deduced from the mode, method and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.\n[41]\nIf it is proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiments, then a conspiracy may be inferred though no actual meeting among them to concert is proved.\n[42]\nThese truisms find more application in administrative proceedings where, as earlier intimated, the quantum of evidence required is substantive evidence, not proof beyond reasonable doubt.\nIn this case, there is ample evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the NLRC, affirming those of the Labor Arbiter, that the dismissed employees, including respondent De Leon, acted in concert to defraud the petitioner. As shown earlier, in not a few instances, the tickets that were fraudulently refunded were processed by respondent De Leon, together with the other dismissed employees, in connection with their functions without which collusion the said anomalies could not have been committed.\nAccordingly, the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter correctly found that the petitioner was justified in terminating the employment of the dismissed employees, including respondent De Leon, as there existed valid and just cause therefor. Their misconduct rendered them unworthy of the trust and confidence reposed on them by the petitioner and warranted their dismissal. The CA committed reversible error in setting aside those findings and conclusions with respect to respondent De Leon.\nWHEREFORE\n, the petition is GRANTED\n.

It furnished them their respective notices of dismissal stating therein the reasons and grounds therefor.\n[5]\nForthwith, Roberto Dinson, Rogelio Manar, Alendry De Leon (respondent herein), Jeffrey De Toro, Arturo Garrido and Perseus Dinglasa filed their respective complaints for illegal dismissal against the petitioner docketed as NLRC SRAB VI Case Nos. 06-12-50415-95, 06-02-50133-96, 06-12-50416-95, 06-02-50135-96, 06-02-50136-96, 06-02-50142-96 and 06-02-50145-96, respectively. Dinglasa's complaint, however, was dismissed without prejudice to its re-filing because he did not sign his complaint and its verification. Only his attorney-in-fact signed the same.\nThe cases were consolidated and jointly tried. The Labor Arbiter conducted a full-blown trial where the petitioner presented three\n[6]\nof its employees who described the procedure the ticket undergoes in the normal course from when the passenger buys it to when it is used with the passenger actually boarding his or her flight. They also explained the scheme employed by the dismissed employees to fraudulently refund the used or flown tickets. Three passengers\n[7]\nalso took the witness stand and testified that while they actually took their scheduled flights, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. These passengers asserted that they did not by themselves, nor did they authorize other persons to, ask for the refund of their tickets. In addition, the petitioner presented in evidence over a hundred documents consisting of, among others, affidavits\n[8]\nor certifications\n[9]\nof passengers who invariably made similar allegations. Also submitted as evidence for the petitioner were the tickets involved in the anomalous transactions.\nFor their part, Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido, Dinglasa and respondent De Leon, as complainants, testified and likewise submitted their respective documentary evidence. They denied any involvement in the anomalous transactions involving the refund of flown or used tickets. They maintained that no irregularity attended the performance of their respective functions. They claimed that the petitioner did not afford them procedural due process.\nAfter due proceedings, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment dismissing the complaints for illegal dismissal. It was held that the petitioner was able to establish by substantial evidence that there was valid and just cause to terminate the employment of the complainants. According to the Labor Arbiter, the testimonies of the three passengers, as well as the affidavits of the other passengers similarly situated, were more than enough evidence to convince an unbiased person that used or flown tickets had indeed been fraudulently refunded. As a result, the petitioner had been deprived of its rightful revenues.\nThe Labor Arbiter found that the used or flown tickets that had been fraudulently refunded were for the flights when Garrido, as the Load Control Clerk, was on duty. For example, the tickets of the passengers who testified during the hearings were turned over to Garrido and contrary to what was required of him, he did not enter their names in the passenger boarding manifest for the said flights. These tickets were later fraudulently refunded. Over a hundred tickets were later discovered to have been similarly fraudulently refunded.\nThe Labor Arbiter further made the finding that Garrido could not have acted alone because he could not cause the tickets to be refunded by himself. Ticket Freight Clerks Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, whose duties included the refunding of tickets, were thus held to have acted in concert with Garrido. Specifically, they participated in the scheme by re-routing and affixing revalidation stickers on the tickets to make it appear that the passengers backed out of their flights and had their new tickets rerouted with open dates. Subsequently, the new tickets were refunded. Other schemes resorted to by these Ticket Freight Clerks included substituting \"adult fare\" tickets, which are charged the full fare, with \"child fare\" tickets, which are charged only half the fare. The \"adult fare\" tickets were then refunded. There were instances also when tickets of paying passengers were replaced with non-revenue tickets (trip passes given to dependents of the petitioner's employees) and the former were then refunded.\nIn finding them to have acted in concert to defraud the petitioner, the Labor Arbiter opined:\nIf there was no connections [\nsic\n] between Garrido on the one hand and Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, there was no way the used tickets would have been refunded.\nIt would be taxing our imagination to absurd limits to make us believe that strangers got hold of these used tickets and complainants Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro so extra gullible that they were not able to detect hundreds of used tickets which strangers presented to them for \"in-lieuing,\" re-routing, revalidating, rescheduling, etc\n. If these were an isolated case then it can be said that human lapses were to blame. When hundreds of tickets are involved, human lapses as an excuse become lame and unbelievable.\nComplainants who are Check-in/Freight Clerks contend that the Cashier and Station Head could have detected then and there the said anomaly since they signed the verification, and certified the same as correct the Daily Sales Report submitted by complainants. This does not exculpate complainants from their actions which were later found to be anomalous. At most, the Cashier and the Station Head were negligent in the performance of their duties but complainants are still liable for their anomalous refunds.\n[10]\nThe claim of denial of due process was, likewise, given scant consideration as the Labor Arbiter declared that the dismissed employees were given ample opportunity to present their side. Accordingly, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaints as he declared that the petitioner was justified in terminating the employment of Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido and respondent De Leon.\nThe dismissed employees then elevated the case to the NLRC. Their appeal was docketed as NLRC Case No. V-000583-98. In the Decision dated June 30, 2000, the NLRC denied the appeal as it affirmed in toto the findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter.\nRefuting the dismissed employees' contention that conspiracy had not been established, the NLRC expounded that \"conspiracy\" should not be given its technical meaning in criminal law. Rather, it is sufficient for purposes of labor proceedings that it had been established by substantial evidence consisting of the testimonies of the passengers and other documentary evidence that the appellants participated in the realization of the fraudulent refund of tickets.\nOnly respondent De Leon filed with the CA a petition for certiorari imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in rendering the decision which affirmed that of the Labor Arbiter.\nIn the assailed Decision dated April 25, 2003, the appellate court reversed the decision of the NLRC with respect to respondent De Leon. The CA held that there was no sufficient evidence to establish that respondent De Leon conspired with the other employees in fraudulently refunding the used or flown tickets. The CA explained that the fact that respondent De Leon \"changed, re-routed or re-issued\" four tickets and \"affixed revalidation stickers\" on three tickets which were later fraudulently refunded does not automatically establish that these were done by him for the purpose of defrauding the petitioner of its revenues and as part of the alleged conspiracy against PAL.\nThe CA ratiocinated, thus:\n[I]t was possible that petitioner [respondent De Leon] was not aware that the tickets which were brought to him for \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" were already used or flown. As Ticket Freight Clerk, \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" are part of the usual and normal functions of petitioner's nature of work. The latter had no reason to suspect that the tickets brought to him were already used or flown since under normal procedures, used or flown tickets should not even be brought to his office in the first place, but should have been posted by the Load Control Clerk. Under the circumstances, it is only the Load Control Clerk which could be attributed with the knowledge that the tickets were already used, but not the Ticket Freight Clerk.\nThe fact that the tickets have \"check-in markings\" on them could not be taken against petitioner since the tickets were not perforated. When tickets have been flown or used, they are perforated and sent to the Accounting and Auditing Division together with the passenger manifest. Without the perforation, the \"check-in markings\" may not be considered unusual or suspicious, for there are cases when passengers back-out from their flights even after they have already checked-in. In these instances, the tickets are given back with the \"check-in markings.\"\nThe possibility that petitioner might have been taken advantage of by his co-workers, who were responsible for the perpetration of the anomalous transactions, cannot be discounted. This doubt, as to petitioner's participation in the fraudulent scheme against PAL should be resolved in favor of petitioner. In case of doubt, cases should be resolved in favor of labor, pursuant to the social justice policy of our labor laws and the Constitution.\n[11]\nThe CA concluded that the petitioner was not able to discharge its burden of proving that there existed valid and just cause to dismiss respondent De Leon. It thus declared that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that respondent De Leon effected refunds of used or flown tickets in furtherance of the conspiracy to perpetrate fraud against PAL. The dispositive portion of the assailed CA decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, finding merit in the petition, the same is hereby GRANTED and the assailed decision of the NLRC is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.\nFinding petitioner's dismissal from employment to be illegal, private respondent PAL is hereby ordered to reinstate petitioner to his former position, without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, or in lieu of reinstatement, if the same is no longer possible, to pay petitioner a separation pay equivalent to one (1) month's salary for every year of service rendered by the latter. Private respondent PAL is likewise ordered to pay backwages in favor of petitioner from the time the latter was illegally dismissed until his reinstatement, or until the finality of this decision, in case reinstatement is no longer possible.\nSO ORDERED.", "facts": "The factual backdrop of the case is as follows:\nOn September 15, 1995, the petitioner received a copy of the complaint of Cesar Villanueva addressed to the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation. Villanueva alleged therein that he purchased a round trip ticket for the petitioner's Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo flight route. He further averred that he took PAL flight PR 140 bound for Manila on August 22, 1995. Instead of taking the return flight to Iloilo, however, Villanueva decided to take the boat. Subsequently, he went to the PAL office in Iloilo to request for a refund of his unused Manila-Iloilo ticket. To his consternation, he was told that his ticket did not show that he took the PR 140 (Iloilo-Manila) flight on August 22, 1995 and neither did his name appear in the passenger boarding manifest for the said flight. Upon further verification, it was discovered that another person had collected the refund of his Manila-Iloilo ticket.\nVillanueva's complaint triggered an investigation conducted by the petitioner through its internal audit. The initial findings showed that PAL Ticket No. 079 2420943398 was issued to Villanueva for the Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. He was originally booked on PAL flight PR 140 for Iloilo-Manila on August 22, 1995. Villanueva actually took that flight and surrendered the Iloilo-Manila coupon of his ticket to the petitioner's check-in counter in Iloilo. The Check-in Clerks then on duty were Perseus Dinglasa and Claude Corpuz while the Load Control Clerk was Arturo Garrido.\nGenerally, a Check-in Clerk is tasked to receive the tickets of passengers and issue to them their respective boarding passes corresponding to their flights. Upon receipt of the ticket, the Check-in Clerk is required to indicate thereon the passenger's boarding sequence number\n[2]\nand seat number and baggage information. The Check-in Clerk is also required to put his or her initials on the ticket. These checked-in tickets are to be turned over by the Check-in Clerk to the Load Control Clerk who shall log or list the passengers' names in the passenger boarding manifest or flight manifest. The Load Control Clerk shall, thereafter, invalidate these checked-in tickets by perforating or punching two holes on the lower right hand corner of each ticket.\nHowever, with respect to Villanueva's ticket, which was surrendered to Check-in Clerks Dinglasa and Corpuz, it did not bear any boarding sequence number, seat number or baggage information. Neither did it bear the initials of Dinglasa or Corpuz. Worse, Villanueva's name did not appear in the flight manifest prepared by Garrido. It appeared that Villanueva's checked-in ticket was not invalidated by Garrido as it did not bear any perforation or punched holes.\nThe investigation further showed that Villanueva's PAL Ticket No. 079 2420943398 was cancelled and in lieu thereof PAL Ticket No. 079 2420946097 was issued in his name, this time for the Bacolod-Manila route initially with an open date. The new ticket was issued by Ticket Freight Clerk Roberto Dinson. Thereafter, it was received by respondent Alendry De Leon, also a Ticket Freight Clerk, who affixed revalidation sticker No. 11277306 thereon showing booking on PAL flight PR 134 (Bacolod-Manila) on August 30, 1995. Subsequently, payment for the refund of Villanueva's new ticket was made by Dinson.\nTicket Freight Clerks are, among other tasks, responsible for issuing revalidation stickers in cases of rebookings and cancellations by passengers of their flight reservations. They are also authorized to refund tickets to bona fide refund applicants. In the refund of tickets, the Ticket Freight Clerks are required to observe certain procedural safeguards to ensure that the person requesting for the refund is the same person whose name appears in the ticket. Ticket Freight Clerks are thus required to: verify the identity of the person requesting and receiving the refund; note down the identification documents presented therefor; require the person receiving the refund to affix his or her signature on the sticker; and have a responsible officer countersign the ticket.\nUpon finding that irregularities attended the refund of Villanueva's ticket, the petitioner conducted a more thorough investigation on the other tickets that had been refunded in its Iloilo Airport Ticket Office for the period of July to September 1995. The petitioner's auditors were able to contact those passengers who purportedly had their tickets refunded. These passengers confirmed that they actually took their flights but, upon verification, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest of their respective flights. Further, they did not ask for the refund of their tickets. Some even turned over the passenger coupons of their flown or used tickets or boarding passes to prove that they took their flights. More than sixty (60) passengers executed affidavits and/or certificates attesting that they actually took their respective flights and that they did not request for any refund of their used or flown tickets nor cancelled their bookings.\nThe petitioner then formed a Special Committee to look into the anomalous transactions. The modus operandi was outlined, thus:\nUpon presentation by the passenger of his ticket to the Check-in Clerk, the Check-in Clerk issues a Boarding Pass. Without indicating the passenger's sequence number, seat number, baggage information, nor his initial, the Check-in Clerk forwards the flight ticket coupon to the Load Control Clerk for posting/listing of the name of the passenger in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest; The Load Control Clerk instead of posting/listing the needed data in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest forwards the flight ticket coupon (\nwithout invalidating/perforating it\n) to Ticket Freight Clerks/Check-in Clerks where the surrendered flight ticket coupon is either:\nRerouted, reissued or \"in-lieued\" to another sector; Revalidated to make it appear that the passenger backed out; Revalidated to open status.\nThe above-mentioned activities of the Ticket Freight Clerks and Check-in Clerks after the flight ticket coupons are handed to them by [the] Load Control Clerk allow them to refund the same without arousing suspicion from the Station and Accounting Department. There are instances specially in cases of full flights where full fare coupons were even substituted with child fare (half fare) tickets issued to fictitious persons or non-revenue tickets (trip pass) of their dependents to ensure that the passenger whose ticket they intend to refund is assured a seat and would not be bumped off to prevent early detection of this malevolent scheme.\n[3]\nFrom the foregoing, it was deduced that the scheme could only have been effected by the employees of the petitioner themselves and by not just one but several of them acting in concert. The investigation showed that the fraudulent refunds were perpetrated by the following employees:\nMr. Perseus Dinglasa Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Claude Corpuz Clerk Porter/Check-In Clerk Mr. Nestor Resma Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Arturo Garrido Load Control Clerk Mr. Alendry de Leon Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Jeffrey de Toro Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Roberto Dinson Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Rogelio Manar Ticket Freight Clerk These eight employees were all assigned at the petitioner's Iloilo Airport Ticket Office. It appeared that the anomalous transactions occurred whenever these employees were on duty and that the fraudulently refunded tickets passed through their hands for processing.\nConsequently, administrative charges were filed against them for \"Fraud against the Company, Falsification of Company Documents and Failure on the Job.\" Each of the eight employees was furnished with their respective notices of the administrative charges against them. The notices uniformly read:\nThe results of the fact-finding committee confirms (sic) your involvement in a concerted action to defraud the company of its rightful revenues by your deliberate participation in the mishandling of; lifted coupons of passengers later verified to have used/flown their tickets; resulting to passenger not being manifested on his flight; and/or substitution of the tickets of these passengers with child fare tickets; and/or issuance of fictitious child fare tickets to be used in the aforementioned substitution; and/or entering false information in the lifted tickets by affixing revalidation stickers as a spurious assumption of backing out from a flight; and/or in-lieuing of lifted flight coupons to same or different routing; and ultimately refunding of the tampered tickets; and/or improper use of space accommodation.\nBe advised therefore that after due consideration and evaluation of the fact-finding committee of the evidence on hand and circumstances pertinent thereto, there appears a probable cause to administratively charge you for the offense of:\nA. FRAUD – under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 57 as defined as follows:\nFRAUD AGAINST THE COMPANY Any employee who deliberately or negligently makes a false presentation of facts or any kind of deception, or a false or fraudulent claim against the company; or knowingly or with gross negligence, initiates or takes part in any action intended to defraud the company or to obtain a payment, benefit or gain from the company to which he or [a] third party is not entitled, or knowingly honors a forged signature for his own benefit or that of another person; or accepts, submits or gives due course or approval to a document knowing it to be false or erroneous, under or overvalued, shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nB. FALSIFICATION OF COMPANY DOCUMENTS under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 60, as defined as follows:\nFALSIFICATION Falsification of a company document or the use of a falsified document or false information is a serious misconduct. Any employee who, shall falsify, conceal or fabricate company documents or records, or enters false information on any official company document shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nActs of falsification include not only tampering with or altering documents or records, but also that of representing falsely or distorting, or violating the truth.\nC. FAILURE ON THE JOB under Chapter II, Sec. 2, Art. 25 defined as follows:\nFAILURE ON THE JOB Any employee who demonstrates his refusal or inability without justifiable reasons or cause to perform the duties and responsibilities on his job and to accomplish the performance and productivity standards thereof shall be meted the penalty AS PRESCRIBED IN THE SCHEDULE OF PENALTIES UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THIS CODE, depending upon the gravity and/or frequency of the offense and whether the evidence shows the situation to be temporary and remediable or permanent and incurable. WHERE SUCH ACT OR ACTS AMOUNT TO ANY OF THE JUST CAUSES FOR TERMINATION UNDER ARTICLE 282 OF THE LABOR CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES, THE PENALTY SHALL BE DISMISSAL.\nYour particular participation in this conspiracy to defraud the company and other violations so mentioned are summarized in the attached schedule under \"responsible employee.\"\nThe foregoing charges constitute grave abuse of trust and confidence reposed upon you by the company, which are sufficient grounds for your dismissal from employment not only under [the] Code of Discipline but also under the Labor Code as amended, without prejudice to the company filing a criminal complaint.\nYou are given ten (10) calendar days from receipt of this notice within which to answer the charge/s contained herein. You may submit your sworn written answer or counter-affidavit with sworn statements of your witness, if any, and other supporting documents.\nSince it appears that your continued employment poses a serious and eminent threat to the interests of the company you are hereby placed on preventive suspension for thirty (30) days immediately upon receipt of this notice.\n[4]\nAs indicated in the notices, the said employees were given ten (10) days to submit their respective sworn written answers to the charges against them. Clarificatory hearings were conducted by the petitioner's Administrative Investigating Panel where the said employees appeared with their respective counsels. Thereafter, the panel submitted its report and recommendation finding the eight employees guilty of the charges against them. Accordingly, the petitioner meted the penalty of dismissal on these employees. It furnished them their respective notices of dismissal stating therein the reasons and grounds therefor.\n[5]\nForthwith, Roberto Dinson, Rogelio Manar, Alendry De Leon (respondent herein), Jeffrey De Toro, Arturo Garrido and Perseus Dinglasa filed their respective complaints for illegal dismissal against the petitioner docketed as NLRC SRAB VI Case Nos. 06-12-50415-95, 06-02-50133-96, 06-12-50416-95, 06-02-50135-96, 06-02-50136-96, 06-02-50142-96 and 06-02-50145-96, respectively. Dinglasa's complaint, however, was dismissed without prejudice to its re-filing because he did not sign his complaint and its verification. Only his attorney-in-fact signed the same.\nThe cases were consolidated and jointly tried. The Labor Arbiter conducted a full-blown trial where the petitioner presented three\n[6]\nof its employees who described the procedure the ticket undergoes in the normal course from when the passenger buys it to when it is used with the passenger actually boarding his or her flight. They also explained the scheme employed by the dismissed employees to fraudulently refund the used or flown tickets. Three passengers\n[7]\nalso took the witness stand and testified that while they actually took their scheduled flights, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest thereof. These passengers asserted that they did not by themselves, nor did they authorize other persons to, ask for the refund of their tickets. In addition, the petitioner presented in evidence over a hundred documents consisting of, among others, affidavits\n[8]\nor certifications\n[9]\nof passengers who invariably made similar allegations. Also submitted as evidence for the petitioner were the tickets involved in the anomalous transactions.\nFor their part, Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido, Dinglasa and respondent De Leon, as complainants, testified and likewise submitted their respective documentary evidence. They denied any involvement in the anomalous transactions involving the refund of flown or used tickets. They maintained that no irregularity attended the performance of their respective functions. They claimed that the petitioner did not afford them procedural due process.\nAfter due proceedings, the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment dismissing the complaints for illegal dismissal. It was held that the petitioner was able to establish by substantial evidence that there was valid and just cause to terminate the employment of the complainants. According to the Labor Arbiter, the testimonies of the three passengers, as well as the affidavits of the other passengers similarly situated, were more than enough evidence to convince an unbiased person that used or flown tickets had indeed been fraudulently refunded. As a result, the petitioner had been deprived of its rightful revenues.\nThe Labor Arbiter found that the used or flown tickets that had been fraudulently refunded were for the flights when Garrido, as the Load Control Clerk, was on duty. For example, the tickets of the passengers who testified during the hearings were turned over to Garrido and contrary to what was required of him, he did not enter their names in the passenger boarding manifest for the said flights. These tickets were later fraudulently refunded. Over a hundred tickets were later discovered to have been similarly fraudulently refunded.\nThe Labor Arbiter further made the finding that Garrido could not have acted alone because he could not cause the tickets to be refunded by himself. Ticket Freight Clerks Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, whose duties included the refunding of tickets, were thus held to have acted in concert with Garrido. Specifically, they participated in the scheme by re-routing and affixing revalidation stickers on the tickets to make it appear that the passengers backed out of their flights and had their new tickets rerouted with open dates. Subsequently, the new tickets were refunded. Other schemes resorted to by these Ticket Freight Clerks included substituting \"adult fare\" tickets, which are charged the full fare, with \"child fare\" tickets, which are charged only half the fare. The \"adult fare\" tickets were then refunded. There were instances also when tickets of paying passengers were replaced with non-revenue tickets (trip passes given to dependents of the petitioner's employees) and the former were then refunded.\nIn finding them to have acted in concert to defraud the petitioner, the Labor Arbiter opined:\nIf there was no connections [\nsic\n] between Garrido on the one hand and Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro, there was no way the used tickets would have been refunded.\nIt would be taxing our imagination to absurd limits to make us believe that strangers got hold of these used tickets and complainants Dinson, Manar, De Leon and De Toro so extra gullible that they were not able to detect hundreds of used tickets which strangers presented to them for \"in-lieuing,\" re-routing, revalidating, rescheduling, etc\n. If these were an isolated case then it can be said that human lapses were to blame. When hundreds of tickets are involved, human lapses as an excuse become lame and unbelievable.\nComplainants who are Check-in/Freight Clerks contend that the Cashier and Station Head could have detected then and there the said anomaly since they signed the verification, and certified the same as correct the Daily Sales Report submitted by complainants. This does not exculpate complainants from their actions which were later found to be anomalous. At most, the Cashier and the Station Head were negligent in the performance of their duties but complainants are still liable for their anomalous refunds.\n[10]\nThe claim of denial of due process was, likewise, given scant consideration as the Labor Arbiter declared that the dismissed employees were given ample opportunity to present their side. Accordingly, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaints as he declared that the petitioner was justified in terminating the employment of Dinson, Manar, De Toro, Garrido and respondent De Leon.\nThe dismissed employees then elevated the case to the NLRC. Their appeal was docketed as NLRC Case No. V-000583-98. In the Decision dated June 30, 2000, the NLRC denied the appeal as it affirmed in toto the findings and conclusions of the Labor Arbiter.\nRefuting the dismissed employees' contention that conspiracy had not been established, the NLRC expounded that \"conspiracy\" should not be given its technical meaning in criminal law. Rather, it is sufficient for purposes of labor proceedings that it had been established by substantial evidence consisting of the testimonies of the passengers and other documentary evidence that the appellants participated in the realization of the fraudulent refund of tickets.\nOnly respondent De Leon filed with the CA a petition for certiorari imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in rendering the decision which affirmed that of the Labor Arbiter.\nIn the assailed Decision dated April 25, 2003, the appellate court reversed the decision of the NLRC with respect to respondent De Leon. The CA held that there was no sufficient evidence to establish that respondent De Leon conspired with the other employees in fraudulently refunding the used or flown tickets. The CA explained that the fact that respondent De Leon \"changed, re-routed or re-issued\" four tickets and \"affixed revalidation stickers\" on three tickets which were later fraudulently refunded does not automatically establish that these were done by him for the purpose of defrauding the petitioner of its revenues and as part of the alleged conspiracy against PAL.\nThe CA ratiocinated, thus:\n[I]t was possible that petitioner [respondent De Leon] was not aware that the tickets which were brought to him for \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" were already used or flown. As Ticket Freight Clerk, \"in-lieuing, re-routing, re-issuing and affixing revalidation stickers\" are part of the usual and normal functions of petitioner's nature of work. The latter had no reason to suspect that the tickets brought to him were already used or flown since under normal procedures, used or flown tickets should not even be brought to his office in the first place, but should have been posted by the Load Control Clerk. Under the circumstances, it is only the Load Control Clerk which could be attributed with the knowledge that the tickets were already used, but not the Ticket Freight Clerk.\nThe fact that the tickets have \"check-in markings\" on them could not be taken against petitioner since the tickets were not perforated. When tickets have been flown or used, they are perforated and sent to the Accounting and Auditing Division together with the passenger manifest. Without the perforation, the \"check-in markings\" may not be considered unusual or suspicious, for there are cases when passengers back-out from their flights even after they have already checked-in. In these instances, the tickets are given back with the \"check-in markings.\"\nThe possibility that petitioner might have been taken advantage of by his co-workers, who were responsible for the perpetration of the anomalous transactions, cannot be discounted. This doubt, as to petitioner's participation in the fraudulent scheme against PAL should be resolved in favor of petitioner. In case of doubt, cases should be resolved in favor of labor, pursuant to the social justice policy of our labor laws and the Constitution.\n[11]\nThe CA concluded that the petitioner was not able to discharge its burden of proving that there existed valid and just cause to dismiss respondent De Leon. It thus declared that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in finding that respondent De Leon effected refunds of used or flown tickets in furtherance of the conspiracy to perpetrate fraud against PAL. The dispositive portion of the assailed CA decision reads:", "issues": "issued to Villanueva for the Iloilo-Manila-Iloilo route. He was originally booked on PAL flight PR 140 for Iloilo-Manila on August 22, 1995. Villanueva actually took that flight and surrendered the Iloilo-Manila coupon of his ticket to the petitioner's check-in counter in Iloilo. The Check-in Clerks then on duty were Perseus Dinglasa and Claude Corpuz while the Load Control Clerk was Arturo Garrido.\nGenerally, a Check-in Clerk is tasked to receive the tickets of passengers and issue to them their respective boarding passes corresponding to their flights. Upon receipt of the ticket, the Check-in Clerk is required to indicate thereon the passenger's boarding sequence number\n[2]\nand seat number and baggage information. The Check-in Clerk is also required to put his or her initials on the ticket. These checked-in tickets are to be turned over by the Check-in Clerk to the Load Control Clerk who shall log or list the passengers' names in the passenger boarding manifest or flight manifest. The Load Control Clerk shall, thereafter, invalidate these checked-in tickets by perforating or punching two holes on the lower right hand corner of each ticket.\nHowever, with respect to Villanueva's ticket, which was surrendered to Check-in Clerks Dinglasa and Corpuz, it did not bear any boarding sequence number, seat number or baggage information. Neither did it bear the initials of Dinglasa or Corpuz. Worse, Villanueva's name did not appear in the flight manifest prepared by Garrido. It appeared that Villanueva's checked-in ticket was not invalidated by Garrido as it did not bear any perforation or punched holes.\nThe investigation further showed that Villanueva's PAL Ticket No. 079 2420943398 was cancelled and in lieu thereof PAL Ticket No. 079 2420946097 was issued in his name, this time for the Bacolod-Manila route initially with an open date. The new ticket was issued by Ticket Freight Clerk Roberto Dinson. Thereafter, it was received by respondent Alendry De Leon, also a Ticket Freight Clerk, who affixed revalidation sticker No. 11277306 thereon showing booking on PAL flight PR 134 (Bacolod-Manila) on August 30, 1995. Subsequently, payment for the refund of Villanueva's new ticket was made by Dinson.\nTicket Freight Clerks are, among other tasks, responsible for issuing revalidation stickers in cases of rebookings and cancellations by passengers of their flight reservations. They are also authorized to refund tickets to bona fide refund applicants. In the refund of tickets, the Ticket Freight Clerks are required to observe certain procedural safeguards to ensure that the person requesting for the refund is the same person whose name appears in the ticket. Ticket Freight Clerks are thus required to: verify the identity of the person requesting and receiving the refund; note down the identification documents presented therefor; require the person receiving the refund to affix his or her signature on the sticker; and have a responsible officer countersign the ticket.\nUpon finding that irregularities attended the refund of Villanueva's ticket, the petitioner conducted a more thorough investigation on the other tickets that had been refunded in its Iloilo Airport Ticket Office for the period of July to September 1995. The petitioner's auditors were able to contact those passengers who purportedly had their tickets refunded. These passengers confirmed that they actually took their flights but, upon verification, their names did not appear in the passenger boarding manifest of their respective flights. Further, they did not ask for the refund of their tickets. Some even turned over the passenger coupons of their flown or used tickets or boarding passes to prove that they took their flights. More than sixty (60) passengers executed affidavits and/or certificates attesting that they actually took their respective flights and that they did not request for any refund of their used or flown tickets nor cancelled their bookings.\nThe petitioner then formed a Special Committee to look into the anomalous transactions. The modus operandi was outlined, thus:\nUpon presentation by the passenger of his ticket to the Check-in Clerk, the Check-in Clerk issues a Boarding Pass. Without indicating the passenger's sequence number, seat number, baggage information, nor his initial, the Check-in Clerk forwards the flight ticket coupon to the Load Control Clerk for posting/listing of the name of the passenger in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest; The Load Control Clerk instead of posting/listing the needed data in the Passenger Boarding Manifest/Flight Manifest forwards the flight ticket coupon (\nwithout invalidating/perforating it\n) to Ticket Freight Clerks/Check-in Clerks where the surrendered flight ticket coupon is either:\nRerouted, reissued or \"in-lieued\" to another sector; Revalidated to make it appear that the passenger backed out; Revalidated to open status.\nThe above-mentioned activities of the Ticket Freight Clerks and Check-in Clerks after the flight ticket coupons are handed to them by [the] Load Control Clerk allow them to refund the same without arousing suspicion from the Station and Accounting Department. There are instances specially in cases of full flights where full fare coupons were even substituted with child fare (half fare) tickets issued to fictitious persons or non-revenue tickets (trip pass) of their dependents to ensure that the passenger whose ticket they intend to refund is assured a seat and would not be bumped off to prevent early detection of this malevolent scheme.\n[3]\nFrom the foregoing, it was deduced that the scheme could only have been effected by the employees of the petitioner themselves and by not just one but several of them acting in concert. The investigation showed that the fraudulent refunds were perpetrated by the following employees:\nMr. Perseus Dinglasa Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Claude Corpuz Clerk Porter/Check-In Clerk Mr. Nestor Resma Ticket Freight Clerk/Check-In Clerk Mr. Arturo Garrido Load Control Clerk Mr. Alendry de Leon Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Jeffrey de Toro Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Roberto Dinson Ticket Freight Clerk Mr. Rogelio Manar Ticket Freight Clerk These eight employees were all assigned at the petitioner's Iloilo Airport Ticket Office. It appeared that the anomalous transactions occurred whenever these employees were on duty and that the fraudulently refunded tickets passed through their hands for processing.\nConsequently, administrative charges were filed against them for \"Fraud against the Company, Falsification of Company Documents and Failure on the Job.\" Each of the eight employees was furnished with their respective notices of the administrative charges against them. The notices uniformly read:\nThe results of the fact-finding committee confirms (sic) your involvement in a concerted action to defraud the company of its rightful revenues by your deliberate participation in the mishandling of; lifted coupons of passengers later verified to have used/flown their tickets; resulting to passenger not being manifested on his flight; and/or substitution of the tickets of these passengers with child fare tickets; and/or issuance of fictitious child fare tickets to be used in the aforementioned substitution; and/or entering false information in the lifted tickets by affixing revalidation stickers as a spurious assumption of backing out from a flight; and/or in-lieuing of lifted flight coupons to same or different routing; and ultimately refunding of the tampered tickets; and/or improper use of space accommodation.\nBe advised therefore that after due consideration and evaluation of the fact-finding committee of the evidence on hand and circumstances pertinent thereto, there appears a probable cause to administratively charge you for the offense of:\nA. FRAUD – under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 57 as defined as follows:\nFRAUD AGAINST THE COMPANY Any employee who deliberately or negligently makes a false presentation of facts or any kind of deception, or a false or fraudulent claim against the company; or knowingly or with gross negligence, initiates or takes part in any action intended to defraud the company or to obtain a payment, benefit or gain from the company to which he or [a] third party is not entitled, or knowingly honors a forged signature for his own benefit or that of another person; or accepts, submits or gives due course or approval to a document knowing it to be false or erroneous, under or overvalued, shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nB. FALSIFICATION OF COMPANY DOCUMENTS under Chapter 2, Sec. 7, Art. 60, as defined as follows:\nFALSIFICATION Falsification of a company document or the use of a falsified document or false information is a serious misconduct. Any employee who, shall falsify, conceal or fabricate company documents or records, or enters false information on any official company document shall suffer the penalty of dismissal.\nActs of falsification include not only tampering with or altering documents or records, but also that of representing falsely or distorting, or violating the truth.\nC. FAILURE ON THE JOB under Chapter II, Sec. 2, Art. 25 defined as follows:\nFAILURE ON THE JOB Any employee who demonstrates his refusal or inability without justifiable reasons or cause to perform the duties and responsibilities on his job and to accomplish the performance and productivity standards thereof shall be meted the penalty AS PRESCRIBED IN THE SCHEDULE OF PENALTIES UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THIS CODE, depending upon the gravity and/or frequency of the offense and whether the evidence shows the situation to be temporary and remediable or permanent and incurable. WHERE SUCH ACT OR ACTS AMOUNT TO ANY OF THE JUST CAUSES FOR TERMINATION UNDER ARTICLE 282 OF THE LABOR CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES, THE PENALTY SHALL BE DISMISSAL.\nYour particular participation in this conspiracy to defraud the company and other violations so mentioned are summarized in the attached schedule under \"responsible employee.\"\nThe foregoing charges constitute grave abuse of trust and confidence reposed upon you by the company, which are sufficient grounds for your dismissal from employment not only under [the] Code of Discipline but also under the Labor Code as amended, without prejudice to the company filing a criminal complaint.\nYou are given ten (10) calendar days from receipt of this notice within which to answer the charge/s contained herein.

SP No. 67424 dated September 13, 2002, and the Resolution dated February 5, 2003 denying the motion for reconsideration thereof. The assailed decision affirmed in toto the decision of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, granting the petition for certification election filed    by respondent Laguna Autoparts Manufacturing Corporation Obrero Pilipino-LAMCOR Chapter.\nOn May 3, 1999, the respondent union filed a petition for certification election before the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Regional Office No. IV, Calamba, Laguna. In its petition, the respondent union alleged that Obrero Pilipino was a legitimate labor organization under Registration Certificate No. NCR-LF-11-04-92 issued by DOLE on November 11, 1992 and that its chapter affiliate, LAMCOR Chapter, had been assigned Control No. RO400-9807-CC-030 dated March 23, 1999. A copy of the respondent union’s Certificate of Creation was attached to the petition. The petition further alleged that the bargaining unit sought to be represented was composed of all the rank-and-file employees in the petitioner company, more or less, 160 employees. It averred that the said bargaining unit is unorganized and that there has been no certification election conducted for the past 12 months prior to the filing of the petition.\n[2]\nThe petitioner company moved to dismiss the petition for certification election. It claimed that the respondent union was not a legitimate labor organization for failure to show that it had complied with the registration requirements, such as the submission of the following requirements to the Regional Office or the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR):\nProof of payment of registration fee; List of officers and their addresses, and the address of the principal place of business of the union; Minutes of the organizational meeting and the list of workers who participated in the said meeting; Names of the members comprising at least twenty percent (20%) of all the employees in the bargaining unit where the union seeks to operate; Copies of financial reports or books of accounts; and Copies of petitioner’s constitution and by-laws, minutes of its adoption or ratification, and list of members who participated in it.\n[3]\nThe petitioner company further asserted in the said motion that even if the respondent union was issued a certificate of registration, it could not file a petition for certification election since its legal personality was at question.\n[4]\nOn October 24, 2000, Med-Arbiter Anastasio L. Bactin dismissed the petition for certification election for the respondent union’s lack of legal personality. The Med-Arbiter found that the respondent union had not yet attained the status of a legitimate labor organization because it failed to indicate its principal office on the documents it submitted to the Regional Office. He opined that this was a fatal defect tantamount to failure to submit the complete requirements, which warranted the dismissal of the petition for certification election.\n[5]\nThe respondent union appealed the case to the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Patricia A. Sto. Tomas, who ruled as follows:\nWHEREFORE\n, the appeal is GRANTED\n. The order dated 24 October 2000 of the Med-Arbiter is REVERSED and SET ASIDE\n. Accordingly, let the entire records of this case be remanded to the regional office of origin for the immediate conduct of a certification election, subject to the usual pre-election conference, among the rank-and-file employees of Laguna Auto Parts Manufacturing Corporation (LAMCOR), with the following choices:\nObrero Pilipino –LAMCOR Chapter; and No Union Pursuant to Section 11.1, Rule XI of the New Implementing Rules, the employer is hereby directed to submit to the regional office of origin the certified list of current employees in the bargaining unit for the last three months prior to the issuance of this decision.\nSO DECIDED.\n[6]\nFinding no cogent reason to alter her decision, the Secretary of Labor and Employment denied the motion for reconsideration thereof.\n[7]\nNot convinced, the petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the CA on the following grounds:\nI.    PUBLIC RESPONDENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FINDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION; II.    THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FINDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT IS A LEGITIMATE LABOR UNION DESPITE LACK OF REGISTRATION AS SUCH.\n[8]\nOn September 13, 2002, the CA rendered a Decision in favor of the respondent union, thus:\nWHEREFORE\n, the instant petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed decision of the Secretary of Labor and Employment is AFFIRMED in toto\n.\nSO ORDERED.\n[9]\nThe CA stressed that a local or chapter need not be registered to become a legitimate labor organization. It pointed out that a local or chapter acquires legal personality as a labor organization from the date of filing of the complete documents enumerated in Section 1\n[10]\nof Rule VI of the Implementing Rules of Book V (as amended by Department Order [D.O.] No. 9). The CA held that the findings of the Labor Secretary was amply supported by the records; such findings would not be reversed since she is considered to have acquired expertise as her jurisdiction is confined to specific matters. The CA, citing the case of Pagpalain Haulers, Inc. vs. Trajano\n, [11]\nalso upheld the validity of D.O. No. 9 since the petitioner failed to show that it was contrary to law or the Constitution.\nFinally, the CA noted that it was the employer which offered the most tenacious resistance to the holding of a certification election among its regular rank-and-file employees. It opined that this must not be so for the choice of a collective bargaining agent was the sole concern of the employees, and the employer should be a mere bystander.\n[12]\nThe petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the CA decision, but the same was likewise denied in a Resolution dated February 5, 2003.\nHence, this petition for review wherein the petitioner relies on the sole ground –\nWITH DUE RESPECT, THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERRORS OF FACTS AND LAW WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE DECISION DATED JULY 5, 2001 OF THE HON. SECRETARY PATRICIA STO. TOMAS IN THE CASE IN RE: PETITION FOR CERTIFICATION ELECTION AMONG THE RANK- AND-FILE EMPLOYEES OF LAGUNA AUTO PARTS MFTG. CORP. CASE NO. RO400-9905-RU-001 WHEN IT RENDERED ITS DECISION DATED SEPTEMBER 13, 2002.\n[13]\nThe issues are the following: (a) whether or not the respondent union is a legitimate labor organization; (b) whether or not a chapter’s legal personality may be collaterally attacked in a petition for certification election; and (c) whether or not the petitioner, as the employer, has the legal standing to oppose the petition for certification election.\nThe petitioner submits that there is no law prohibiting it from questioning and impugning the status of the respondent union even in a petition for certification election.  It stresses that the right to file a petition for certification election is a mere statutory right and, to enjoy such right, the respondent union must comply with the requirements provided under the law, particularly the requirement that the applicant must be a legitimate labor organization.  In this case, the Med-Arbiter found that the respondent union, which is a local or chapter, had not yet attained the status of a legitimate labor organization for failure to indicate its principal office on the list of officers it submitted to the Regional Office.  The petitioner insists that substantial compliance with the requirements is not sufficient; as such, even if such address was indicated in the other documents submitted to the Regional Office, the requirement would still not be considered fulfilled. The petitioner concludes that the respondent union, therefore, does not have the right to file a petition for certification election.\nThe petitioner further postulates that in order to be considered legitimate, a labor organization must be issued a certificate of registration. It contends that D.O. No. 9, insofar as it requires that the mere submission of documentary requirements as sufficient to give legitimate personality to a labor organization, is ultra vires\n. The petitioner avers that the said Department Order could not amend Article 234 of the Labor Code which clearly states that the registration of a union is the operative act that imbues it with legitimate personality.\nThe petitioner then argues that since the mere submission of documents does not vest legitimate status on a local or chapter, it follows that such status may be questioned collaterally in a petition for certification election. It adds that the issue of whether or not the respondent union has the legal personality must first be resolved before the petition for certification election should be granted.\nFinally, the petitioner maintains that in a number of cases, [14]\nthe employer was allowed to question the status of the union-applicant in a petition for certification election.\n[15]\nFor its part, the respondent union avers that the petitioner’s active participation in the representation proceedings was an act of intervention of the employee’s right to self-organization. It asserts that the CA was correct in finding that the petitioner did not observe a strictly hands-off policy in the representation proceedings, in violation of established jurisprudence.  It argues that the petitioner’s alleged violation of the requirements of D.O. No. 9, for failure to indicate its principal address, has already been resolved by the decision of the Secretary of Labor and Employment.\n[16]\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\nIn a petition for review on certiorari as a mode of appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, a petitioner can raise only questions of law — the Supreme Court is not the proper venue to consider a factual issue as it is not a trier of facts.\n[17]\nFindings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only great respect but even finality.\n[18]\nThis is particularly true where the CA affirms such findings of fact. In this case, the CA affirmed the finding of the Secretary of Labor and Employment that the respondent union is a legitimate labor organization.\nIndeed, a local or chapter need not be independently registered to acquire legal personality. Section 3, Rule VI of the Implementing Rules of Book V, as amended by D.O. No. 9 clearly states —\nSEC. 3.\nAcquisition of legal personality by local/chapter.\n— A local/chapter constituted in accordance with Section 1 of this Rule shall acquire legal personality from the date of filing of the complete documents enumerated therein. Upon compliance with all documentary requirements, the Regional Office or Bureau shall issue in favor of the local/chapter a certificate indicating that it is included in the roster of legitimate labor organizations.\n[19]\nAs gleaned from the said provision, the task of determining whether the local or chapter has submitted the complete documentary requirements is lodged with  the Regional Office or the BLR, as the case may be. The records of the case show that the respondent union submitted the said documents to Regional Office No. IV and was subsequently issued the following certificate:\nCERTIFICATE OF CREATION OF LOCAL/ CHAPTER NO.\nThis certifies that as of July 16, 1998 the OBRERO PILIPINO-LAMCOR submitted to this Office Charter Certificate No. 07-98 issued by OBRERO PILIPINO with complete supporting documents. From said date, it has acquired legal personality as a labor organization. It shall have the right to represent its members for all purposes not contrary to law or applicable regulations and to its constitution and by-laws.\nThe legitimate personality of OBRERO PILIPINO-LAMCOR CHAPTER is without prejudice to whatever grounds for revocation or cancellation as may be prescribed by applicable laws and regulations.\nMarch 23, 1999 Date By:\n(SGD.)\nRAYMUNDO G. AGRAVANTE Labor Relations Division Chief\n[20]\nHence, the Regional Office, through the Labor Relations Division Chief, has determined that the respondent union complied with the requirements under the law. It, therefore, declared that the respondent union has acquired legal personality as a labor organization. Absent any pronouncement to the contrary, such determination of the Labor Relations Division Chief will stand, on the presumption that the duty of determining whether the respondent union submitted the complete documentary requirements has been regularly performed.\nWe rule, however, that such legal personality may not be subject to a collateral attack but only through a separate action instituted particularly for the purpose of assailing it. This is categorically prescribed by Section 5, Rule V of the Implementing Rules of Book V, which states as follows:\nSEC. 5.\nEffect of registration\n.— The labor organization or workers’ association shall be deemed registered and vested with legal personality on the date of issuance of its certificate of registration.\nSuch legal personality cannot thereafter be subject to collateral attack but may be questioned only in an independent petition for cancellation in accordance with these Rules\n.\n[21]\nHence, to raise the issue of the respondent union’s legal personality is not proper in this case. The pronouncement of the Labor Relations Division Chief, that the respondent union acquired a legal personality with the submission of the complete documentary requirement, cannot be challenged in a petition for certification election.\nThe discussion of the Secretary of Labor and Employment on this point is also enlightening, thus:\n… Section 5, Rule V of D.O. 9 is instructive on the matter. It provides that the legal personality of a union cannot be the subject of collateral attack in a petition for certification election, but may be questioned only in an independent petition for cancellation of union registration. This has been the rule since NUBE v. Minister of Labor, 110 SCRA 274 (1981). What applies in this case is the principle that once a union acquires legitimate status as a labor organization, it continues as such until its certificate of registration is cancelled or revoked in an independent action for cancellation.\nEqually important is Section 11, Paragraph II, Rule IX of D.O. 9, which provides for the dismissal of a petition for certification election based on the lack of legal personality of a labor organization only in the following instances: (1) appellant is not listed by the Regional Office or the BLR in its registry of legitimate labor organizations; or (2) appellant’s legal personality has been revoked or cancelled with finality. Since appellant is listed in the registry of legitimate labor organizations, and its legitimacy has not been revoked or cancelled with finality, the granting of its petition for certification election is proper.\n[22]\nFinally, on the issue of whether the petitioner has the legal standing to oppose the petition for certification election, we rule in the negative. Our ruling in San Miguel Foods, Inc.-Cebu B-Meg Feed Plant v. Laguesma\n[23]\nis still sound, thus:\nIn any case, this Court notes that it is petitioner, the employer, which has offered the most tenacious resistance to the holding of a certification election among its monthly-paid rank-and-file employees. This must not be so, for the choice of a collective bargaining agent is the sole concern of the employees. The only exception to this rule is where the employer has to file the petition for certification election pursuant to Article 258 of the Labor Code because it was requested to bargain collectively, which exception finds no application in the case before us. Its role in a certification election has aptly been described in Trade Unions of the Philippines and Allied Services (TUPAS) v. Trajano\n, as that of a mere bystander. It has no legal standing in a certification election as it cannot oppose the petition or appeal the Med-Arbiter’s orders related thereto. …\n[24]\nIn conclusion, we find no reversible error in the CA’s decision dismissing the petition for certiorari for the nullification of the decision of the Secretary of Labor and Employment. It should be stressed that certiorari will issue only to correct errors of jurisdiction and not to correct errors of judgment or mistakes in the tribunal’s findings and conclusions.\n[25]\nThe petitioner failed to demonstrate any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Secretary of Labor and Employment in granting the petition for certification election.\nWHEREFORE\n, premises considered, the petition is DENIED DUE COURSE.

NO. 149357, March 04, 2005 ]\nMOBILIA PRODUCTS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. HAJIME UMEZAWA, RESPONDENT.\nG.R. NO. 149403 PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HON. JUDGE RUMOLDO R. FERNANDEZ AND HAJIME UMEZAWA, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N CALLEJO, SR., J.:\nBefore the Court are two consolidated petitions: a petition for review on certiorari filed by the People of the Philippines, docketed as G.R. No. 149403 of the Resolution\n[1]\nof the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 52440 which reversed its decision and granted the petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus filed by respondent Hajime Umezawa; and the petition for review on certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 149357 filed by petitioner Mobilia Products, Inc. (MPI), the intervenor in the CA, assailing the same Resolution of the appellate court.\nThe Antecedents The antecedents were amply summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the petition at bar, to wit:\nMobilia Products, Inc. is a corporation engaged in the manufacture and export of quality furniture which caters only to the purchase orders booked and placed through Mobilia Products Japan, the mother company which does all the marketing and booking.  After orders from customers are booked at the mother company in Japan, the same are coursed through Mobilia Philippines for implementation and production, after which, the ordered items are shipped to Japan through the mother company.\nMobilia Products Japan sent Hajime Umezawa to the Philippines in order to head Mobilia Products, Inc. as President and General Manager.  To qualify him as such and as a Board Director, he was entrusted with one nominal share of stock.\nSometime in the last week of January 1995, Umezawa, then the President and General Manager of Mobilia Products, Inc., organized another company with his wife Kimiko, and his sister, Mitsuyo Yaguchi, to be known as Astem Philippines Corporation, without the knowledge of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Susumo Kodaira and the other members of the Board of Directors of Mobilia.\nThe said company would be engaged in the same business as Mobilia. Spouses Umezawa recruited Justin Legaspi, former Production Manager of Mobilia, to act as Manager and one Yoshikazu Hayano of Phoenix Marble Corporation to serve as investors [sic].\nPending formal organization, Spouses Umezawa, Justin Legaspi and Yoshikazu Hayano wanted to accelerate the market potentials of Astem by participating in the International Furniture Fair 1995 held at the Word Trade Centre of on March 6 to 10, 1995.\nOne of the requirements of such Fair was that the furniture exhibits must arrive and be received at not later than February 23, 1995. Pressed for time, with less than one month to prepare and while Astem had yet no equipment and machinery, no staff and no ready personnel, Umezawa, with grave abuse of the confidence reposed on him as President and General Manager of Mobilia Products, Inc., and in conspiracy with his wife, his sister Mitsuyo Yaguchi, Yoshikazu Hayano and Justin Legaspi, all with intent to gain for themselves and for their company Astem Philippines Corporation, stole prototype furniture from petitioner Mobilia so that the said pieces of furniture would be presented and exhibited as belonging to Astem in the International Furniture Fair ’95 in .\nIn order to avoid detection, Umezawa contacted Henry Chua, the owner of Dew Foam, one of the suppliers of Mobilia, for that the latter to load several pieces of prototype furniture into a Dew Foam truck and store them at the Dew Foam warehouse. The first batch of furniture was stolen on February 8, 1995, when Mr. Henry Chua, upon the request of respondent Umezawa, caused  to be loaded into his Dew Foam truck two prototype sofa models worth P500,000.00, after which, the same were spirited from the Mobilia compound, then transported and stored in  Henry Chua’s warehouse.\nAgain, on February 18, 1995, Umezawa, with grave abuse of confidence and taking advantage of his position as President and General Manager, unlawfully stole expensive furniture from Mobilia’s factory worth P2,964,875.00. In order to avoid detection, the said furniture were loaded in the truck belonging to Dew Foam, with respondent Umezawa personally supervising the loading, the carting and spiriting away of the said furniture.  Thus, taking advantage of his position as General Manager, he managed to have the said furniture taken out of the company premises and passed the company guard without any problem and difficulty.\nFurther, on February 19, 1995, around 1 o’clock in the afternoon, respondent Umezawa again loaded into his motor vehicle, and took away from    company premises under the same irregular and unlawful circumstances, an expensive three-seater sofa worth P255,000.00.\nThe taking out of the said furniture was effected in violation of the standard procedures established by petitioner corporation which requires that every shipment or taking out of the furniture be checked and reviewed by Mobilia’s Production, Planning, Inventory Costing and Control (PPICC) Division.  All the foregoing furniture were transported to and stored at Henry Chua’s warehouse. After sometime, the foregoing furniture were photographed for slide photos at Photo Folio at the Reclamation Area, Cebu City and then finally catalogued for use in the Fair for the use of Astem and its supposed owners, namely: spouses Umezawa, Hayano and Legaspi.  The foregoing furniture models were finally shipped for exhibition at the International Furniture Fair ’95 in as furniture belonging to Astem Philippines Corporation.\nSometime in March 1995, based on orders booked for Astem, Umezawa, with unfaithfulness and abuse of confidence reposed on him as the President and General Manager of petitioner Mobilia, ordered and caused the manufacture of eighty-nine (89) pieces of furniture with a total value of P17,108,500.00.  The said pieces of furniture were made with Mobilia supplies, materials and machineries, as well as with Mobilia time and personnel, all of which were under the administration and control of Umezawa as President and General Manager. The said materials and supplies, the time and labor, were supposed to be used for the manufacture and production of quality furniture for the EXCLUSIVE USE of Mobilia.  However, Umezawa, in violation of his duty to apply the same for the use of Mobilia and the duty to account for the same, converted their use for the benefit of Astem or for the use and benefit of Umezawa, his wife and sister, Yoshikazu Hayano and Legaspi, much to the damage and prejudice of Mobilia Products.\nThe same furniture could also have been taken out of the company premises by Umezawa and cohorts for shipment and delivery to Astem customers had it not been for the timely discovery of the previous theft. …\n[2]\nThe Board of Directors of MPI, consisting of its Chairman Susumo    Kodaira and members Yasushi Kato and Rolando Nonato, approved a Resolution on May 2, 1995 authorizing the filing of a complaint against Umezawa for two counts of qualified theft allegedly committed on February 18 and 19, 1995.  Attached to the complaint was the Joint Affidavit of Danilo Lallaban, George del Rio and Yasushi Kato.  The case was docketed as I.S. No. 95-275.\nOn May 15, 1995, the public prosecutor filed an Information for qualified theft against Umezawa with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lapu-Lapu City.  The accusatory portion of the Information, docketed as Criminal Case No. 013231-L, reads:\nThat during or about the period comprised between the 18th and 19th day of February 1995, in the City of Lapu-Lapu, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, while being then the President and General Manager of Mobilia Products, Inc., a corporation engaged in the manufacture and export of furniture, holding office and doing business in the Mactan Export Processing Zone, Lapu-Lapu City, with grave abuse of the confidence reposed upon him by his employer, with intent to gain, did then and there willfully,  unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away from the corporation’s factory in Mactan Export Processing Zone, Lapu-Lapu City, expensive pieces of furniture, to wit:\n1) 1 set, Model No. 3, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth  - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - P  208,125.00 2) 1 set, Model No. 8, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - -  P  315,000.00 3) 1 set, Model No. 5, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  P  108,000.00 4) 1 set, Model No. 4, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth  - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - P   277,500.00 5) 1 set, Model No. 6, 1-seater German leather sofa, worth  - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - P   146,250.00 6) 1 set, Model No. 2, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth  - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - P   225,000.00 7) 1 set, Model No. 1, 2-seater German leather sofa, worth  - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - P   275,000.00 8) 1 piece, Model Table No. 2, Italian marble table, worth - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - P     93,750.00 9) 1 piece, Model Table No. 4, Italian marble table, worth - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - P    105,000.00 10) 2 pieces, Model Pedestal No. 6, Italian marble pedestal, worth -- - - - - - - - - - - - P   150,000.00 11) 1 piece, Model Column Standard No. 11, Italian marble worth -- - - - - - - - - - - P     93,750.00 12) 1 piece, Model Table No. 1, Italian marble table, worth - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - -  - - - - P   105,000.00 13) 1 piece, Model High Table No. 10, Italian marble, worth - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - P   187,500.00 14) 1 piece, Model Table No. 8, Italian marble table, worth  - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - P    187,500.00 15) 1 piece, Model Table No. 7 Italian marble table, worth  - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - P    187,500.00 16) 1 piece, Model Table No. 5 Italian marble table, worth  - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - P   112,500.00 17) 1 piece, Model Table No. 9, Italian marble table, worth  - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - P   187,500.00 18) 3-seater sofa, worth-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - P   255,000.00 with an aggregate value of P3,219,875.00, Philippine currency, without the consent of his employer, to the damage and prejudice of Mobilia Products, Inc., in the said amount of P3,219,875.00.\nContrary to law.\n[3]\nOn motion of the prosecution, the trial court issued a writ of preliminary attachment covering the properties of Umezawa.\nUmezawa then filed an Omnibus Motion to quash the information filed against him, the discharge of the writ of attachment issued by the trial court, and to set the case for preliminary investigation.  MPI, the private complainant therein, opposed the motion.\nIn the meantime on July 21, 1995, MPI filed another criminal complaint for qualified theft against Umezawa, his wife Kimiko Umezawa, Mitsuyo Yaguchi, Justin Legaspi, Yoshikazu Hayano and Henry Chua allegedly committed in March 1995, with the Office of the City Prosecutor.  The case was docketed as I.S. No. 95-442.\nOn July 25, 1995, the trial court issued an Order in Criminal Case No. 013231-L denying the omnibus motion.  On joint motion of Umezawa and the public prosecutor, the trial court ordered a reinvestigation of the case.   Conformably, the public prosecutor conducted a reinvestigation of Criminal Case No. 013231-L jointly with I.S. No. 95-442.\nOn September 25, 1995, Umezawa filed a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), docketed as SEC Case No. 002919, for the nullification of the Resolution issued by the three alleged members of MPI Board of Directors, authorizing the filing of criminal complaints against him in behalf of the corporation.\nOn January 3, 1996, the public prosecutor issued a Joint Resolution finding probable cause for qualified theft and one count of estafa against Umezawa, and dismissing the case against the other accused.  The Prosecutor maintained his finding of probable cause against Umezawa in Criminal Case No. 013231-L.\nOn February 20, 1996, the public prosecutor filed an Information for qualified theft with the RTC of Lapu-Lapu City against Umezawa, docketed as Criminal Case No. 013423-L. The accusatory portion reads:\nThat on the 8th day of February 1995, in the City of Lapu-Lapu, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while being the President and General Manager of Mobilia Products, Inc., a corporation engaged in the manufacture and export of quality furniture, whose principal place of business is at the Mactan Export Processing Zone, Lapu-Lapu City, with intent to gain, without the consent of his employer, and with grave abuse of confidence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away from the corporation’s factory the following expensive pieces of furniture, to wit:\n1) 1 set, Model No. 2, 2-seater German leather sofa, all valued at  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    P      225,000.00 2) 1 set, Model No. 1, 2-seater German leather sofa, all valued at . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . P      275,000.00 with an aggregate value of P500,000.00 Philippine Currency, to the damage and  prejudice of Mobilia Products, Inc.\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n[4]\nAnother Information for estafa was thereafter filed against the same accused, docketed as Criminal Case No. 013424-L.  The accusatory portion reads:\nThat sometime in March 1995, in the City of Lapu-Lapu, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of unfaithfulness and abuse of confidence reposed upon him as the President and General Manager of Mobilia Products, Inc., did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate and convert to his own personal use and benefit the amount of Seventeen Million One Hundred Eight Thousand Five Hundred (P17,108,500.00) Pesos, Philippine Currency, which was the total value of the furnitures ordered and manufactured by the accused or at his instance using Mobilia supplies, materials and machineries, as well as time and personnel  which were supposed to be for the exclusive use of Mobilia Products, Inc. but were converted for the use and benefit of the accused and Astem Philippines Corporation, a company or firm engaged in the same business as that of Mobilia Products, Inc., which is, [in] the manufacture and production of quality furniture  for export, owned by the accused, to the damage and prejudice of Mobilia Products, Inc.\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n[5]\nOn April 25, 1996, Umezawa filed a motion for the suspension of the proceedings on the ground of the pendency of his petition with the SEC in Case No. 002919.  The trial court, however, issued an Order on May 21, 1996, denying the said motion. It held that the filing and the pendency of a petition before the SEC did not warrant a suspension of the criminal cases.\nOn September 25, 1998, Umezawa was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.\nOn September 30, 1998, Umezawa filed anew a Joint Motion to Quash the Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 013231-L and 013423-L, on the ground that the facts alleged therein did not constitute the felony of qualified theft.  Umezawa claimed that based on the Joint Affidavit of the witnesses for the prosecution submitted during the preliminary investigation, Yasushi Kato and George del Rio, MPI Vice-President and the head of the Upholstery Department, respectively, the appropriate charge should be estafa and not qualified theft.  Umezawa further claimed that for their failure to object to and resist his alleged delictual acts, the said witnesses were as guilty as he was and should have been included in the Information. He also asserted that there was, likewise, no allegation in the Informations as to who was the owner of the articles stolen; hence, there was no offended party.  He noted that the Informations merely alleged that MPI was his employer.  He further posited that there was no valid charge against him because the resolution authorizing the filing of the cases against him was approved by a mere minority of the members of the MPI Board of Directors.\n[6]\nUmezawa, likewise, filed a Motion to Quash\n[7]\nthe Information in Criminal Case No. 013424-L on the ground that the facts alleged in the Information did not constitute the felony of estafa.  He posited that the Information did not contain any allegation that any demand was made for him to return the goods. Furthermore, the owner of the said articles was not specified.  He noted that as gleaned from the Joint Affidavit of the witnesses for the prosecution, there was no lawful private complainant. He reiterated that the MPI board resolution authorizing the filing of the charge against him was not approved by the majority of the members of its board of directors.  Umezawa also alleged that the charge for estafa with abuse of confidence was already included in the charge for qualified theft, where it was alleged that he committed theft with abuse of confidence; hence, the charge for estafa should be quashed, otherwise, he would be placed in double jeopardy. The motion was duly opposed by the prosecution.\nOn January 29, 1999, the trial court issued a Joint Order\n[8]\ndismissing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.  It held that the dispute between the private complainant and the accused over the ownership of the properties subject of the charges is intra-corporate in nature, and was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  It ruled that Umezawa, as a member of the board of directors and president of MPI, was also a stockholder thereof. While Umezawa claimed to be the bona fide owner of the properties subject of the Informations which he appropriated for himself, the private complainant disputes the same; hence, according to the trial court, the conflicting claims of the parties should be resolved by the SEC.  The private and public prosecutors received their respective copies of the Joint Order on February 2, 1999.\nThe MPI, through the private prosecutor, filed a motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the court and for the reinstatement of the cases on February 15, 1999. The MPI relied on the following grounds:\nThe Honorable Court has jurisdiction and must exercise it over these cases; The above-entitled case is not an intra\n-corporate controversy; and The accused could not claim ownership nor co-ownership of the properties of private complainant corporation.\n[9]\nThe MPI maintained that the trial court had jurisdiction over the cases and cited Section 5 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 902-A, which provides the rules on cases over which the SEC has original and exclusive jurisdiction. A copy of the motion was served on the public prosecutor for his approval.  However, the public prosecutor did not affix his conformity to the motion, and instead opted to appear before the trial court during the hearing of the same.  During the hearing, both the public and private prosecutors appeared. In support of his motion, the private prosecutor argued that the trial of the case must be done in the presence of and under the control and supervision of the public prosecutor.\n[10]\nThe trial court denied the motion in an Order dated April 19, 1999. It held that the SEC, not the trial court, had jurisdiction over intra-corporate controversies.  It also ruled that the motion of the private complainant was pro forma, it appearing that the public prosecutor had not approved the same.\nThe public prosecutor received a copy of the Order on April 20, 1999. On April 26, 1999, the People of the Philippines, through the OSG, filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the CA against Presiding Judge Rumuldo R. Fernandez and Umezawa, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 52440.   The CA allowed the MPI to intervene as petitioner, and admitted its petition- in-intervention.\nThe People of the Philippines, as the petitioner therein, raised the following issues:\nI WHETHER OR NOT IT IS THE LEGAL AND MINISTERIAL DUTY OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT TO TAKE COGNIZANCE AND JURISDICTION OF THESE SUBJECT CRIMINAL CASES; II WHETHER OR NOT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST RESPONDENT HAJIME UMEZAWA; III WHETHER OR NOT   RESPONDENT JUDGE COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING THE CRIMINAL CASES AND DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.\n[11]\nThe People asserted that the controversy involving the criminal cases was not between Umezawa and the other stockholders of MPI, but one between him as the accused therein and the People of the Philippines.  It averred that under Section 20(b) of Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 129, the RTC has exclusive jurisdiction over the cases against Umezawa. It also alleged that in dismissing the criminal cases against Umezawa on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over the crimes charged, the RTC committed grave abuse of its discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction.\nOn September 2, 1999, the CA rendered judgment granting the petition and nullifying the assailed Orders of the RTC.  It ruled that the issue of ownership of the properties subject of the Informations was not an intra-corporate dispute.  It held that Umezawa, although president and general manager of the MPI and a stockholder thereof, was not a joint owner or co-owner of the personal properties subject of the charges.  It also held that the dispute between a private corporation and any of its stockholders relative to the ownership of properties does not ipso facto negate the jurisdiction of the RTC over the criminal cases under B.P. Blg. 129, as amended.  It also declared that the material averments of the Informations sufficiently charged qualified theft and estafa.\nUmezawa filed a motion for the reconsideration of the decision of the CA. In a complete volte face, the appellate court issued a Resolution   on August 8, 2001, granting the motion and reversing its decision.  It affirmed the ruling of the RTC that the dispute between Umezawa and the other stockholders and officers over the implementation of the MPI’s standard procedure is intra-corporate in nature; hence, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC. Citing Section 5(a)(b) of P.D. No. 902-A, and the ruling of this Court in Alleje v. Court of Appeals, [12]\nthe appellate court ruled that based on the material allegations of the Solicitor General in the petition before the CA, the SEC had exclusive jurisdiction over the conflicting claims of the parties.  It likewise affirmed the ruling of the RTC that the absence of any allegation in the Information that the MPI was the owner of the properties subject of the Information is fatal.\nThe petitioner MPI filed the instant petition for review on certiorari, raising the following issues:\nI WHETHER OR NOT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST UMEZAWA.\nII WHETHER OR NOT ALL THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF THE CRIMES OF QUALIFIED THEFT AND ESTAFA ARE SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATIONS.\nIII EVEN ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE FACTS ALLEGED DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFENSE THE CORRECT RULING IS NOT TO DISMISS  THE CASE BUT TO ORDER AMENDMENT.\nIV WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE HS LOST ITS RIGHT TO APPEAL.\nV WHETHER OR NOT THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF UMEZAWA IS PRO FORMA.\n[13]\nThe People of the Philippines filed a separate petition for review on certiorari, contending that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FINDING THAT THE PETITION FOR MANDAMUS, CERTIORARI AND INJUNCTION WAS FILED OUT OF TIME AND THAT PETITIONER HAS LOST ITS RIGHT TO APPEAL; THE COURT OF APEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW IN RULING THAT NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF QUALIFIED THEFT AND ESTAFA ARE PRESENT; THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED BLATANT AND SERIOUS  ERRORS OF LAW IN FINDING THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT CRIMINAL CASES; THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO THE PRO-FORMA MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF UMEZAWA.\n[14]\nThe two petitions were consolidated in the Second Division of the Court.\nThe threshold issues for resolution are the following: (a) whether or not the petition for certiorari of the People of the Philippines in the CA assailing the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court was time-barred; (b) whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the crimes charged in the said Informations; (c) whether the Informations sufficiently charge the felonies of qualified theft and estafa; and (d) if in the affirmative, whether all the elements of qualified theft and estafa are alleged in the Informations.\nOn the first issue, the CA held that the Public Prosecutor failed to file a motion for the reconsideration of the trial court’s January 29, 1999 Joint Order dismissing the cases, that is, within fifteen days from receipt of a copy of the said order on February 2, 1999; neither did the People appeal the said Order within the period therefor.  Thus, according to the CA, the People filed its petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus assailing the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court only on April 26, 1999, well beyond the 60-day period therefor.  The appellate court, likewise, held that the filing of the motion for reconsideration of the said Joint Order by the private prosecutor without the conformity of the Public Prosecutor did not toll the period for the People to file its motion for reconsideration thereof, or to appeal therefrom, or to file a petition for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. It ruled that, having lost its right to appeal in due course, the People was proscribed from filing a petition for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. The CA declared that the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner MPI of the Joint Order of the RTC is pro forma, the public prosecutor not having signified his written conformity thereto.\nOn the other hand, the petitioner People of the Philippines insists that while the public prosecutor did not expressly conform to the motion for reconsideration of the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court filed by the private prosecutor, through the public prosecutor’s presence during the hearing of the said motion, his supervision and control over the private prosecutor during the said hearing, he in effect adopted and conformed to the said motion for reconsideration.\nIn his comment on the petitions, respondent Umezawa maintains that the motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the trial court filed by the private prosecutor did not interrupt the period within which the People could appeal, citing the ruling of this Court in Cabral v. Puno.\n[15]\nThe respondent posits that the finding of the trial court, which was affirmed by the CA, that the public prosecutor did not conform to the motion for reconsideration of the private prosecutor, is binding on this Court.  The respondent also avers that the petitioner has no personality to file the petition. Moreover, he insists that whether the public prosecutor conformed to the private prosecutor’s motion for reconsideration is a question of fact which is not proper in a petition for review on certiorari.\nThe Court’s Ruling The contention of the petitioner People of the Philippines is not correct. All criminal actions commenced by complaint or information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor.\n[16]\nWhen the civil action for civil liability is instituted in the criminal action pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the offended party may intervene, by counsel, in the prosecution of the offense.\n[17]\nIn Ramiscal, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan, [18]\nwe held that under Section 16, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the offended party may intervene in the criminal action personally or by counsel, who will then act as private prosecutor for the protection of his interests and in the interest of the speedy and inexpensive administration of justice.  A separate action for the purpose would only prove to be costly, burdensome and time-consuming for both parties and further delay the final disposition of the case.  The multiplicity of suits must be avoided. With the implied institution of the civil action in the criminal action, the two actions are merged into one composite proceeding, with the criminal action predominating the civil.  The prime purpose of the criminal action is to punish the offender in order to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense, to isolate him from society, reform and rehabilitate him or, in general, to maintain social order.\n[19]\nThe intervention of the private offended party, through counsel, and his prosecution of the case shall be under the control and supervision of the public prosecutor until the final termination of the case.  A public prosecutor who has been entrusted by law with the prosecution of criminal cases is duty-bound to take charge thereof until its final termination, for under the law, he assumes full responsibility for his failure or success since he is the one more adequately prepared to pursue it to its termination.\n[20]\nThe prosecution of offenses is a public function.  Indeed, the sole purpose of the civil action is the resolution, reparation or indemnification of the private offended party for the damage or injury he sustained by reason of the delictual or felonious act of the accused.\n[21]\nUnder Article 104 of the Revised Penal Code, the following are the civil liabilities of the accused:\nART. 104.\nWhat is included in civil liability.\n— The civil liability established in Articles 100, 101, 102 and 103 of this Code includes:\nRestitution; Reparation of the damage caused; Indemnification for consequential damages.\nThus, when the offended party, through counsel, has asserted his right to intervene in the proceedings, it is error to consider his appearance merely as a matter of tolerance.\n[22]\nThe public prosecutor may turn over the actual prosecution of the criminal case, in the exercise of his discretion, but he may, at any time, take over the actual conduct of the trial.  However, it is necessary that the public prosecutor be present at the trial until the final termination of the case; otherwise, if he is absent, it cannot be gainsaid that the trial is under his supervision and control.\n[23]\nIn a criminal case in which the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the offended party is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom.  Hence, if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, a reconsideration of the order of dismissal or acquittal may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, insofar as the criminal aspect thereof is concerned and may be made only by the public prosecutor; or in the case of an appeal, by the State only, through the OSG.  The private complainant or offended party may not undertake such motion for reconsideration or appeal on the criminal aspect of the case.\n[24]\nHowever, the offended party or private complainant may file a motion for reconsideration of such dismissal or acquittal or appeal therefrom but only insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned.\n[25]\nIn so doing, the private complainant or offended party need not secure the conformity of the public prosecutor.  If the court denies his motion for reconsideration, the private complainant or offended party may appeal or file a petition for certiorari or mandamus, if grave abuse amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction is shown and the aggrieved party has no right of appeal or given an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\nThe public and private prosecutors are not precluded, whenever feasible, from filing a joint motion for the reconsideration of the dismissal of the case or the acquittal of the accused, on the criminal and civil aspects of the cases.\nIn the present case, only petitioner MPI, through counsel, filed a motion for the reconsideration of the trial court’s Joint Order dated January 29, 1999, praying for the reinstatement of the cases insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned.  The public prosecutor did not approve nor conform to the said motion.  Although petitioner MPI provided ample space for the said conformity of the public prosecutor, the latter did not do so; he merely appeared during the hearing of the said motion with the private prosecutor when the latter presented his oral arguments in support of the said motion.\nThe fact that the public prosecutor did not conform to the said motion, however, does not mean that the same is pro forma.\nIt must be stressed that the propriety and efficacy of the motion, insofar as the civil aspect of the cases is concerned, is not dependent upon the conformity of the public prosecutor.  Hence, the filing of the joint motion for reconsideration effectively suspended the running of the period for petitioner MPI to assail the joint order in the CA via an appeal or a special civil action for certiorari or mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.\nHowever, since the public prosecutor did not file any motion for the reconsideration of the joint order nor conform to the motion of petitioner MPI, insofar as the criminal aspect of the cases is concerned, the period for the State to assail the said joint order was not suspended.  Only the motion for reconsideration filed by the public prosecutor of the joint order of dismissal of the cases could have tolled the period within which the State could appeal, insofar as the criminal aspect of the cases was concerned.  The bare fact that the public prosecutor appeared for the State during the hearing of the motion for reconsideration of petitioner MPI does not amount to or constitute his adoption of the said motion as that of the State.  As ruled by this Court in Cabral v. Puno:\n[26]\nWhile it is true that the offended party, Silvino San Diego, through the private prosecutor, filed a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary fifteen-day period, such move did not stop the running of the period for appeal.  He did not have the legal personality to appeal or file the motion for reconsideration on his behalf.  The prosecution in a criminal case through the private prosecutor is under the direction and control of the Fiscal, and only the motion for reconsideration or appeal filed by the Fiscal could have interrupted the period for appeal.\n[27]\nWe agree with the ruling of the CA that the petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner People of the Philippines with the CA on April 26, 1999 was filed beyond the 60-day period as provided in Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, [28]\nit appearing that the public prosecutor received a copy of the joint order of the trial court on February 2, 1999, and, thus, had only until April 3, 1999 within which to file the said petition.\nEven then, the Court still holds that the CA erred in dismissing the petition of the People of the Philippines simply because the public prosecutor erred in not himself filing a motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the trial court, on his perception that by being present during the hearing of the motion for reconsideration of petitioner MPI, he thereby adopted the said motion as that of the State’s.  The settled rule is that the State is not estopped by the mistakes of its officers and employees. Indeed, in Cruz, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, [29]\nthe Court declared:\n… Estoppel does not lie against the government because of the supposedly mistaken acts or omissions of its agents. As we declared in People v. Castañeda, “there is the long familiar rule that erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not block subsequent correct application of the statute and that the government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its agents.”\nThe Court also held in Chua v. Court of Appeals:\n[30]\n… While ordinarily, certiorari is unavailing where the appeal period has lapsed, there are exceptions.  Among them are (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d)\nwhen the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. …\n[31]\nOn the second issue, the petitioners assert that the CA erred in holding that the dispute between it and the respondent is intra-corporate in nature; hence, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  As gleaned from the material allegations of the Informations, the RTC had exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged.  Petitioner MPI further avers that even if there is no allegation in the Informations identifying it as the owner of the personal properties described in the Informations, its ownership of the properties can be inferred from the other allegations.  The petitioners maintain that even if the Informations are deficient, the remedy is the amendment of the Informations and not the dismissal of the cases.\nFor his part, the respondent avers that the assailed Resolution of the CA is correct, and that it is the appellate court’s decision which is erroneous.\nWe agree with the petitioners.\nAccording to Section 20 of B.P. Blg. 129 –\nSEC. 20.\nJurisdiction in criminal cases.\n— Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all criminal cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal or body, except those now falling under the exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan which shall hereafter be exclusively taken cognizance of by the latter.\nSection 32 thereof was later amended by Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7691, as follows:\nSec. 32.\nJurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in Criminal Cases.\n– Except in cases falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court and of the Sandiganbayan, the Metropolitan Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise:\n(1) Exclusive original jurisdiction over all violations of city or municipal ordinances committed within their respective territorial jurisdiction; and\n(2) Exclusive original jurisdiction over all offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding six (6) years irrespective of the amount of fine, and regardless of other imposable accessory or other penalties, including the civil liability arising from such offenses or predicated thereon, irrespective of kind, nature, value or amount thereof:\nProvided, however, That in offenses involving damage to property through criminal negligence, they shall have exclusive original jurisdiction thereof.\nCase law has it that in order to determine the jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases, the complaint or Information must be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the facts set out therein and the prescribed period provided for by law are within the jurisdiction of the court, and where the said Information or complaint is filed. It is settled that the jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or Information and not by the findings based on the evidence of the court after trial.\n[32]\nJurisdiction is conferred only by the Constitution or by the law in force at the time of the filing of the Information or complaint.  Once jurisdiction is vested in the court, it is retained up to the end of the litigation. Indeed, in People v. Purisima, [33]\nthis Court held that:\nIn criminal prosecutions, it is settled that the jurisdiction of the court is not determined by what may be meted out to the offender after trial or even by the result of the evidence that would be presented at the trial, but by the extent of the penalty which the law imposes for the misdemeanor, crime or violation charged in the complaint. If the facts recited in the complaint and the punishment provided for by law are sufficient to show that the court in which the complaint is presented has jurisdiction, that court must assume jurisdiction.\nIn Criminal Case No. 013231-L, the value of the properties subject of qualified theft is P3,219,875.00, while in Criminal Case No. 013423-L, the value of the property was pegged at P255,000.00. Under Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for theft when the value of the stolen property exceeds P22,000.00 is as follows:\nThe penalty of prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods, if the value of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 20,000 pesos; but if the value of the thing stolen exceeds the latter amount, the penalty shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph and one year of each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.  In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be.\nArticle 310 of the Revised Penal Code further provides for the penalty for qualified theft:\nArt. 310.\nQualified theft.\n– The crime of theft shall be punished by the penalties next higher by two degrees than those respectively specified in the next preceding article, if committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the premises of a plantation, fish taken from a fishpond or fishery or if property is taken on the occasion of fire, earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, or any other calamity, vehicular accident or civil disturbance.\nOn the other hand, in Criminal Case No. 013424-L for estafa, the amount of the fraud involved is P500,000.00, and under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for such crime is –\n1 st\n. The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period    to prision mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be.\nPatently, then, based on the material allegations of the Informations in the three cases, the court a quo had exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged.\nThe bare fact that the respondent was the president and general manager of the petitioner corporation when the crimes charged were allegedly committed and was then a stockholder thereof does not in itself deprive the court a quo of its exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged. The property of the corporation is not the property of the stockholders or members or of its officers who are stockholders.\n[34]\nAs the Court held in an avuncular case:\n[35]\n... Properties registered in the name of the corporation are owned by it as an entity separate and distinct from its members. While shares of stock constitute personal property, they do not represent property of the corporation. The corporation has property of its own which consists chiefly of real estate (Nelson v. Owen, 113 Ala., 372, 21 So. 75; Morrow v. Gould, 145 Iowa, 1, 123 N.W. 743). A share of stock only typifies an aliquot part of the corporation’s property, or the right to share in its proceeds to that extent when distributed according to law and equity (Hall & Faley v. Alabama Terminal, 173 Ala., 398, 56 So. 235), but its holder is not the owner of any part of the capital of the corporation (Bradley v. Bauder, 36 Ohio St., 28).  Nor is he entitled to the possession of any definite portion of its property or assets (Gottfried v. Miller, 104 U.S., 521; Jones v. Davis, 35 Ohio St., 474).  The stockholder is not a co-owner or tenant in common of the corporate property (Harton v. Johnston, 166 Ala., 317, 51 So., 992) …”\n[36]\nAs early as the case of Fisher v. Trinidad, [37]\nthe Court already declared that “[t]he distinction between the title of a corporation, and the interest of its members or stockholders in the property of the corporation, is familiar and well-settled.  The ownership of that property is in the corporation, and not in the holders of shares of its stock. The interest of each stockholder consists in the right to a proportionate part of the profits whenever dividends are declared by the corporation, during its existence, under its charter, and to a like proportion of the property remaining, upon the termination or dissolution of the corporation, after payment of its debts.”\n[38]\nWe also agree with the ruling of the CA in its decision that the SEC (now the Regional Trial Court) had no jurisdiction over the cases filed in the court a quo.\nThe appellate court’s reliance in the assailed Resolution issued by the Board of Directors of the petitioner corporation, on Section 5(b) of P.D. No. 902, has no factual and legal basis.\nSection 5 of P.D. No. 902-A provides that the SEC\n[39]\nshall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving the following:\n(a) devices or schemes employed by, or any acts of, the board of directors, business associates, its officers or partners, amounting to fraud and misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholders, partners, members of association or organizations registered with the Commission, and\n(b) controversies arising out of intra-corporate  or partnership relations, between and among stockholders, members or associates; between any or all of them and the corporation, partnership or association of which they are stockholders, members or associates, respectively.\nIn Fabia v. Court of Appeals, [40]\nthe Court explained that Section 5 of P.D. No. 902-A should be taken in conjunction with Section 6 of the law.  It then proceeded to explain:\nIn synthesis, Sec. 5 of PD 902-A mandates that cases involving fraudulent actions and devices which are detrimental to the interest of stockholders, members or associates and directors of the corporation are  within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  Taken in conjunction with Sec. 6 of the same law, it will be gathered that the fraudulent acts/schemes which the SEC shall exclusively investigate and prosecute are those “in violation of any law or rules and regulations administered and enforced by the Commission” alone.  This investigative and prosecutorial powers of the SEC are further “without prejudice to any liability for violation of any provision of The Revised Penal Code.\n”\nFrom the foregoing, it can thus be concluded that the filing of the civil/intra-corporate case before the SEC does not preclude the simultaneous and concomitant filing of a criminal action before the regular courts; such that, a fraudulent act may give rise to liability for violation of the rules and regulations of the SEC cognizable by the SEC itself, as well as criminal liability for violation of the Revised Penal Code cognizable by the regular courts, both charges to be filed and proceeded independently, and may be simultaneously with the other.\n[41]\nThus, the filing of a petition in the SEC for the nullification of the Resolution of May 2, 1995 issued by the Chairman and two members of the Board of Directors of petitioner MPI, which authorized the filing of criminal cases against respondent Umezawa, was not a bar to his prosecution for estafa and qualified theft for his alleged fraudulent and delictual acts. The relationship of the party-litigants with each other or the position held by petitioner as a corporate officer in respondent MPI during the time he committed the crime becomes merely incidental and holds no bearing on jurisdiction. What is essential is that the fraudulent acts are likewise of a criminal nature and hence cognizable by the regular courts.\n[42]\nThus, notwithstanding the fact that respondent Umezawa was the president and general manager of petitioner MPI and a stockholder thereof, the latter may still be prosecuted for the crimes charged. The alleged fraudulent acts of respondent Umezawa in this case constitute the element of abuse of confidence, deceit or fraudulent means, and damage under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code on estafa.\n[43]\nWe agree with the encompassing disquisitions of the CA in its decision, to wit:\n… A dispute involving the corporation and its stockholders is not necessarily an intra-corporate dispute cognizable only by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Nor does it ipso facto negate the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court over the subject cases. The Supreme Court citing the case of Viray v. Court of Appeals\n(G.R. No. 92481, 191 SCRA 308 [1990]) in Torio v. Court of Appeals\n(G.R. No. 107293, March 2, 1994, 230 SCRA 626) held:\n“It should be obvious that not every conflict between a corporation and its stockholders involves corporate matters that only the SEC can resolve in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers.”\nAs the Supreme Court further ruled in the Torio case that\n“a contrary interpretation would distort the meaning and intent of P.D. 902-A, the law re-organizing the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The better policy in determining which body has jurisdiction over a case would be to consider not only the relationship of the parties but also the nature of the questions raised in the subject of the controversy.\n[44]\nOn the last issue, we find and so hold that the Informations state all the essential elements of estafa and qualified theft.  It was adequately alleged that respondent Umezawa, being the President and General Manager of petitioner MPI, stole and misappropriated the properties of his employer, more specifically, petitioner MPI.  As expostulated by the CA in its decision:\n… In any event, the allegations in the informations, if hypothetically admitted, are sufficient to bind Umezawa to the charges of qualified theft and estafa.\nAs aptly ruled by the court a quo in its Order of July 25, 1995, all the elements of the offense of qualified theft are present.  There is no basis for claiming otherwise.  Furthermore, the private offended party, as well as the subject matter of the felonious taking and the ownership thereof, have been adequately indicated or identified leaving no room for any doubt on these matters.\nConsidering that the motions to quash of September 30, 1998 are fundamentally rehash of the motion to quash filed on May 29, 1995 and the culpable acts subject of the new informations are virtually the same as the first information filed against Umezawa, there is no conceivable reason why the court a quo abandoned its previous stand and controverted itself in regard the sufficiency of the informations.\nIn our considered view, and as the court a quo had correctly held in its Order of May 26, 1996, “even a SEC ruling voiding the resolution authorizing the filing of criminal charges versus the accused Hajime Umezawa can have no bearing on the validity of the informations filed in these three criminal cases as pointed out by private complainant, the public offenses of qualified theft and estafa can [be] prosecuted de officio.”\nThe resolution of the office of the prosecutor on the preliminary investigation as well as the re-investigation conducted on the letter-complaint filed by private complainant company sufficiently established prima facie case against the accused and the legality or illegality of the constitution of the board which authorized the filing of the complaint does not materially affect either the informations filed against Umezawa or the pending criminal proceedings.  As petitioners contend, the action is now between the People of the Philippines and herein private respondent.\n[45]\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING\n, the petitions are GRANTED.\nThe Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

He also asserted that there was, likewise, no allegation in the Informations as to who was the owner of the articles stolen; hence, there was no offended party.  He noted that the Informations merely alleged that MPI was his employer.  He further posited that there was no valid charge against him because the resolution authorizing the filing of the cases against him was approved by a mere minority of the members of the MPI Board of Directors.\n[6]\nUmezawa, likewise, filed a Motion to Quash\n[7]\nthe Information in Criminal Case No. 013424-L on the ground that the facts alleged in the Information did not constitute the felony of estafa.  He posited that the Information did not contain any allegation that any demand was made for him to return the goods. Furthermore, the owner of the said articles was not specified.  He noted that as gleaned from the Joint Affidavit of the witnesses for the prosecution, there was no lawful private complainant. He reiterated that the MPI board resolution authorizing the filing of the charge against him was not approved by the majority of the members of its board of directors.  Umezawa also alleged that the charge for estafa with abuse of confidence was already included in the charge for qualified theft, where it was alleged that he committed theft with abuse of confidence; hence, the charge for estafa should be quashed, otherwise, he would be placed in double jeopardy. The motion was duly opposed by the prosecution.\nOn January 29, 1999, the trial court issued a Joint Order\n[8]\ndismissing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.  It held that the dispute between the private complainant and the accused over the ownership of the properties subject of the charges is intra-corporate in nature, and was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  It ruled that Umezawa, as a member of the board of directors and president of MPI, was also a stockholder thereof. While Umezawa claimed to be the bona fide owner of the properties subject of the Informations which he appropriated for himself, the private complainant disputes the same; hence, according to the trial court, the conflicting claims of the parties should be resolved by the SEC.  The private and public prosecutors received their respective copies of the Joint Order on February 2, 1999.\nThe MPI, through the private prosecutor, filed a motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the court and for the reinstatement of the cases on February 15, 1999. The MPI relied on the following grounds:\nThe Honorable Court has jurisdiction and must exercise it over these cases; The above-entitled case is not an intra\n-corporate controversy; and The accused could not claim ownership nor co-ownership of the properties of private complainant corporation.\n[9]\nThe MPI maintained that the trial court had jurisdiction over the cases and cited Section 5 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 902-A, which provides the rules on cases over which the SEC has original and exclusive jurisdiction. A copy of the motion was served on the public prosecutor for his approval.  However, the public prosecutor did not affix his conformity to the motion, and instead opted to appear before the trial court during the hearing of the same.  During the hearing, both the public and private prosecutors appeared. In support of his motion, the private prosecutor argued that the trial of the case must be done in the presence of and under the control and supervision of the public prosecutor.\n[10]\nThe trial court denied the motion in an Order dated April 19, 1999. It held that the SEC, not the trial court, had jurisdiction over intra-corporate controversies.  It also ruled that the motion of the private complainant was pro forma, it appearing that the public prosecutor had not approved the same.\nThe public prosecutor received a copy of the Order on April 20, 1999. On April 26, 1999, the People of the Philippines, through the OSG, filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the CA against Presiding Judge Rumuldo R. Fernandez and Umezawa, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 52440.   The CA allowed the MPI to intervene as petitioner, and admitted its petition- in-intervention.\nThe People of the Philippines, as the petitioner therein, raised the following issues:\nI WHETHER OR NOT IT IS THE LEGAL AND MINISTERIAL DUTY OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT TO TAKE COGNIZANCE AND JURISDICTION OF THESE SUBJECT CRIMINAL CASES; II WHETHER OR NOT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST RESPONDENT HAJIME UMEZAWA; III WHETHER OR NOT   RESPONDENT JUDGE COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING THE CRIMINAL CASES AND DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.\n[11]\nThe People asserted that the controversy involving the criminal cases was not between Umezawa and the other stockholders of MPI, but one between him as the accused therein and the People of the Philippines.  It averred that under Section 20(b) of Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 129, the RTC has exclusive jurisdiction over the cases against Umezawa. It also alleged that in dismissing the criminal cases against Umezawa on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over the crimes charged, the RTC committed grave abuse of its discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction.\nOn September 2, 1999, the CA rendered judgment granting the petition and nullifying the assailed Orders of the RTC.  It ruled that", "issues": "the issue of ownership of the properties subject of the Informations was not an intra-corporate dispute.  It held that Umezawa, although president and general manager of the MPI and a stockholder thereof, was not a joint owner or co-owner of the personal properties subject of the charges.  It also held that the dispute between a private corporation and any of its stockholders relative to the ownership of properties does not ipso facto negate the jurisdiction of the RTC over the criminal cases under B.P. Blg. 129, as amended.  It also declared that the material averments of the Informations sufficiently charged qualified theft and estafa.\nUmezawa filed a motion for the reconsideration of the decision of the CA. In a complete volte face, the appellate court issued a Resolution   on August 8, 2001, granting the motion and reversing its decision.  It affirmed", "arguments": "the ruling of the RTC that the dispute between Umezawa and the other stockholders and officers over the implementation of the MPI’s standard procedure is intra-corporate in nature; hence, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC. Citing Section 5(a)(b) of P.D. No. 902-A, and the ruling of this Court in Alleje v. Court of Appeals, [12]\nthe appellate court ruled that based on the material allegations of the Solicitor General in the petition before the CA, the SEC had exclusive jurisdiction over the conflicting claims of the parties.  It likewise affirmed the ruling of the RTC that the absence of any allegation in the Information that the MPI was the owner of the properties subject of the Information is fatal.\nThe petitioner MPI filed the instant petition for review on certiorari, raising the following issues:\nI WHETHER OR NOT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST UMEZAWA.\nII WHETHER OR NOT ALL THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF THE CRIMES OF QUALIFIED THEFT AND ESTAFA ARE SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATIONS.\nIII EVEN ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE FACTS ALLEGED DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFENSE THE CORRECT RULING IS NOT TO DISMISS  THE CASE BUT TO ORDER AMENDMENT.\nIV WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE HS LOST ITS RIGHT TO APPEAL.\nV WHETHER OR NOT THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF UMEZAWA IS PRO FORMA.\n[13]\nThe People of the Philippines filed a separate petition for review on certiorari, contending that:\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FINDING THAT THE PETITION FOR MANDAMUS, CERTIORARI AND INJUNCTION WAS FILED OUT OF TIME AND THAT PETITIONER HAS LOST ITS RIGHT TO APPEAL; THE COURT OF APEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW IN RULING THAT NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF QUALIFIED THEFT AND ESTAFA ARE PRESENT; THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED BLATANT AND SERIOUS  ERRORS OF LAW IN FINDING THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT CRIMINAL CASES; THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS OF LAW AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO THE PRO-FORMA MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF UMEZAWA.\n[14]\nThe two petitions were consolidated in the Second Division of the Court.\nThe threshold issues for resolution are the following: (a) whether or not the petition for certiorari of the People of the Philippines in the CA assailing the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court was time-barred; (b) whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the crimes charged in the said Informations; (c) whether the Informations sufficiently charge the felonies of qualified theft and estafa; and (d) if in the affirmative, whether all the elements of qualified theft and estafa are alleged in the Informations.\nOn the first issue, the CA held that the Public Prosecutor failed to file a motion for the reconsideration of the trial court’s January 29, 1999 Joint Order dismissing the cases, that is, within fifteen days from receipt of a copy of the said order on February 2, 1999; neither did the People appeal the said Order within the period therefor.  Thus, according to the CA, the People filed its petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus assailing the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court only on April 26, 1999, well beyond the 60-day period therefor.  The appellate court, likewise, held that the filing of the motion for reconsideration of the said Joint Order by the private prosecutor without the conformity of the Public Prosecutor did not toll the period for the People to file its motion for reconsideration thereof, or to appeal therefrom, or to file a petition for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. It ruled that, having lost its right to appeal in due course, the People was proscribed from filing a petition for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. The CA declared that the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner MPI of the Joint Order of the RTC is pro forma, the public prosecutor not having signified his written conformity thereto.\nOn the other hand, the petitioner People of the Philippines insists that while the public prosecutor did not expressly conform to the motion for reconsideration of the January 29, 1999 Joint Order of the trial court filed by the private prosecutor, through the public prosecutor’s presence during the hearing of the said motion, his supervision and control over the private prosecutor during the said hearing, he in effect adopted and conformed to the said motion for reconsideration.\nIn his comment on the petitions, respondent Umezawa maintains that the motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the trial court filed by the private prosecutor did not interrupt the period within which the People could appeal, citing the ruling of this Court in Cabral v. Puno.\n[15]\nThe respondent posits that the finding of the trial court, which was affirmed by the CA, that the public prosecutor did not conform to the motion for reconsideration of the private prosecutor, is binding on this Court.  The respondent also avers that the petitioner has no personality to file the petition. Moreover, he insists that whether the public prosecutor conformed to the private prosecutor’s motion for reconsideration is a question of fact which is not proper in a petition for review on certiorari.\nThe Court’s Ruling The contention of the petitioner People of the Philippines is not correct. All criminal actions commenced by complaint or information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor.\n[16]\nWhen the civil action for civil liability is instituted in the criminal action pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the offended party may intervene, by counsel, in the prosecution of the offense.\n[17]\nIn Ramiscal, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan, [18]\nwe held that under Section 16, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the offended party may intervene in the criminal action personally or by counsel, who will then act as private prosecutor for the protection of his interests and in the interest of the speedy and inexpensive administration of justice.  A separate action for the purpose would only prove to be costly, burdensome and time-consuming for both parties and further delay the final disposition of the case.  The multiplicity of suits must be avoided. With the implied institution of the civil action in the criminal action, the two actions are merged into one composite proceeding, with the criminal action predominating the civil.  The prime purpose of the criminal action is to punish the offender in order to deter him and others from committing the same or similar offense, to isolate him from society, reform and rehabilitate him or, in general, to maintain social order.\n[19]\nThe intervention of the private offended party, through counsel, and his prosecution of the case shall be under the control and supervision of the public prosecutor until the final termination of the case.  A public prosecutor who has been entrusted by law with the prosecution of criminal cases is duty-bound to take charge thereof until its final termination, for under the law, he assumes full responsibility for his failure or success since he is the one more adequately prepared to pursue it to its termination.\n[20]\nThe prosecution of offenses is a public function.  Indeed, the sole purpose of the civil action is the resolution, reparation or indemnification of the private offended party for the damage or injury he sustained by reason of the delictual or felonious act of the accused.\n[21]\nUnder Article 104 of the Revised Penal Code, the following are the civil liabilities of the accused:\nART. 104.\nWhat is included in civil liability.\n— The civil liability established in Articles 100, 101, 102 and 103 of this Code includes:\nRestitution; Reparation of the damage caused; Indemnification for consequential damages.\nThus, when the offended party, through counsel, has asserted his right to intervene in the proceedings, it is error to consider his appearance merely as a matter of tolerance.\n[22]\nThe public prosecutor may turn over the actual prosecution of the criminal case, in the exercise of his discretion, but he may, at any time, take over the actual conduct of the trial.  However, it is necessary that the public prosecutor be present at the trial until the final termination of the case; otherwise, if he is absent, it cannot be gainsaid that the trial is under his supervision and control.\n[23]\nIn a criminal case in which the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the offended party is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom.  Hence, if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, a reconsideration of the order of dismissal or acquittal may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, insofar as the criminal aspect thereof is concerned and may be made only by the public prosecutor; or in the case of an appeal, by the State only, through the OSG.  The private complainant or offended party may not undertake such motion for reconsideration or appeal on the criminal aspect of the case.\n[24]\nHowever, the offended party or private complainant may file a motion for reconsideration of such dismissal or acquittal or appeal therefrom but only insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned.\n[25]\nIn so doing, the private complainant or offended party need not secure the conformity of the public prosecutor.  If the court denies his motion for reconsideration, the private complainant or offended party may appeal or file a petition for certiorari or mandamus, if grave abuse amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction is shown and the aggrieved party has no right of appeal or given an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\nThe public and private prosecutors are not precluded, whenever feasible, from filing a joint motion for the reconsideration of the dismissal of the case or the acquittal of the accused, on the criminal and civil aspects of the cases.\nIn the present case, only petitioner MPI, through counsel, filed a motion for the reconsideration of the trial court’s Joint Order dated January 29, 1999, praying for the reinstatement of the cases insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned.  The public prosecutor did not approve nor conform to the said motion.  Although petitioner MPI provided ample space for the said conformity of the public prosecutor, the latter did not do so; he merely appeared during the hearing of the said motion with the private prosecutor when the latter presented his oral arguments in support of the said motion.\nThe fact that the public prosecutor did not conform to the said motion, however, does not mean that the same is pro forma.\nIt must be stressed that the propriety and efficacy of the motion, insofar as the civil aspect of the cases is concerned, is not dependent upon the conformity of the public prosecutor.  Hence, the filing of the joint motion for reconsideration effectively suspended the running of the period for petitioner MPI to assail the joint order in the CA via an appeal or a special civil action for certiorari or mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.\nHowever, since the public prosecutor did not file any motion for the reconsideration of the joint order nor conform to the motion of petitioner MPI, insofar as the criminal aspect of the cases is concerned, the period for the State to assail the said joint order was not suspended.  Only the motion for reconsideration filed by the public prosecutor of the joint order of dismissal of the cases could have tolled the period within which the State could appeal, insofar as the criminal aspect of the cases was concerned.  The bare fact that the public prosecutor appeared for the State during the hearing of the motion for reconsideration of petitioner MPI does not amount to or constitute his adoption of the said motion as that of the State.  As ruled by this Court in Cabral v. Puno:\n[26]\nWhile it is true that the offended party, Silvino San Diego, through the private prosecutor, filed a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary fifteen-day period, such move did not stop the running of the period for appeal.  He did not have the legal personality to appeal or file the motion for reconsideration on his behalf.  The prosecution in a criminal case through the private prosecutor is under the direction and control of the Fiscal, and only the motion for reconsideration or appeal filed by the Fiscal could have interrupted the period for appeal.\n[27]\nWe agree with the ruling of the CA that the petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner People of the Philippines with the CA on April 26, 1999 was filed beyond the 60-day period as provided in Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, [28]\nit appearing that the public prosecutor received a copy of the joint order of the trial court on February 2, 1999, and, thus, had only until April 3, 1999 within which to file the said petition.\nEven then, the Court still holds that the CA erred in dismissing the petition of the People of the Philippines simply because the public prosecutor erred in not himself filing a motion for reconsideration of the joint order of the trial court, on his perception that by being present during the hearing of the motion for reconsideration of petitioner MPI, he thereby adopted the said motion as that of the State’s.  The settled rule is that the State is not estopped by the mistakes of its officers and employees. Indeed, in Cruz, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, [29]\nthe Court declared:\n… Estoppel does not lie against the government because of the supposedly mistaken acts or omissions of its agents. As we declared in People v. Castañeda, “there is the long familiar rule that erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do not block subsequent correct application of the statute and that the government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its agents.”\nThe Court also held in Chua v. Court of Appeals:\n[30]\n… While ordinarily, certiorari is unavailing where the appeal period has lapsed, there are exceptions.  Among them are (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d)\nwhen the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. …\n[31]\nOn the second issue, the petitioners assert that the CA erred in holding that the dispute between it and the respondent is intra-corporate in nature; hence, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  As gleaned from the material allegations of the Informations, the RTC had exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged.  Petitioner MPI further avers that even if there is no allegation in the Informations identifying it as the owner of the personal properties described in the Informations, its ownership of the properties can be inferred from the other allegations.  The petitioners maintain that even if the Informations are deficient, the remedy is the amendment of the Informations and not the dismissal of the cases.\nFor his part, the respondent avers that the assailed Resolution of the CA is correct, and that it is the appellate court’s decision which is erroneous.\nWe agree with the petitioners.\nAccording to Section 20 of B.P. Blg. 129 –\nSEC. 20.\nJurisdiction in criminal cases.\n— Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all criminal cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal or body, except those now falling under the exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan which shall hereafter be exclusively taken cognizance of by the latter.\nSection 32 thereof was later amended by Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7691, as follows:\nSec. 32.\nJurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in Criminal Cases.\n– Except in cases falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court and of the Sandiganbayan, the Metropolitan Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise:\n(1) Exclusive original jurisdiction over all violations of city or municipal ordinances committed within their respective territorial jurisdiction; and\n(2) Exclusive original jurisdiction over all offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding six (6) years irrespective of the amount of fine, and regardless of other imposable accessory or other penalties, including the civil liability arising from such offenses or predicated thereon, irrespective of kind, nature, value or amount thereof:\nProvided, however, That in offenses involving damage to property through criminal negligence, they shall have exclusive original jurisdiction thereof.\nCase law has it that in order to determine the jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases, the complaint or Information must be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the facts set out therein and the prescribed period provided for by law are within the jurisdiction of the court, and where the said Information or complaint is filed. It is settled that the jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or Information and not by the findings based on the evidence of the court after trial.\n[32]\nJurisdiction is conferred only by the Constitution or by the law in force at the time of the filing of the Information or complaint.  Once jurisdiction is vested in the court, it is retained up to the end of the litigation. Indeed, in People v. Purisima, [33]\nthis Court held that:\nIn criminal prosecutions, it is settled that the jurisdiction of the court is not determined by what may be meted out to the offender after trial or even by the result of the evidence that would be presented at the trial, but by the extent of the penalty which the law imposes for the misdemeanor, crime or violation charged in the complaint. If the facts recited in the complaint and the punishment provided for by law are sufficient to show that the court in which the complaint is presented has jurisdiction, that court must assume jurisdiction.\nIn Criminal Case No. 013231-L, the value of the properties subject of qualified theft is P3,219,875.00, while in Criminal Case No. 013423-L, the value of the property was pegged at P255,000.00. Under Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for theft when the value of the stolen property exceeds P22,000.00 is as follows:\nThe penalty of prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods, if the value of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 20,000 pesos; but if the value of the thing stolen exceeds the latter amount, the penalty shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph and one year of each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.  In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be.\nArticle 310 of the Revised Penal Code further provides for the penalty for qualified theft:\nArt. 310.\nQualified theft.\n– The crime of theft shall be punished by the penalties next higher by two degrees than those respectively specified in the next preceding article, if committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the premises of a plantation, fish taken from a fishpond or fishery or if property is taken on the occasion of fire, earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, or any other calamity, vehicular accident or civil disturbance.\nOn the other hand, in Criminal Case No. 013424-L for estafa, the amount of the fraud involved is P500,000.00, and under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for such crime is –\n1 st\n. The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period    to prision mayor in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed prision mayor or reclusion temporal, as the case may be.\nPatently, then, based on the material allegations of the Informations in the three cases, the court a quo had exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged.\nThe bare fact that the respondent was the president and general manager of the petitioner corporation when the crimes charged were allegedly committed and was then a stockholder thereof does not in itself deprive the court a quo of its exclusive jurisdiction over the crimes charged. The property of the corporation is not the property of the stockholders or members or of its officers who are stockholders.\n[34]\nAs the Court held in an avuncular case:\n[35]\n... Properties registered in the name of the corporation are owned by it as an entity separate and distinct from its members. While shares of stock constitute personal property, they do not represent property of the corporation. The corporation has property of its own which consists chiefly of real estate (Nelson v. Owen, 113 Ala., 372, 21 So. 75; Morrow v. Gould, 145 Iowa, 1, 123 N.W. 743). A share of stock only typifies an aliquot part of the corporation’s property, or the right to share in its proceeds to that extent when distributed according to law and equity (Hall & Faley v. Alabama Terminal, 173 Ala., 398, 56 So. 235), but its holder is not the owner of any part of the capital of the corporation (Bradley v. Bauder, 36 Ohio St., 28).  Nor is he entitled to the possession of any definite portion of its property or assets (Gottfried v. Miller, 104 U.S., 521; Jones v. Davis, 35 Ohio St., 474).  The stockholder is not a co-owner or tenant in common of the corporate property (Harton v. Johnston, 166 Ala., 317, 51 So., 992) …”\n[36]\nAs early as the case of Fisher v. Trinidad, [37]\nthe Court already declared that “[t]he distinction between the title of a corporation, and the interest of its members or stockholders in the property of the corporation, is familiar and well-settled.  The ownership of that property is in the corporation, and not in the holders of shares of its stock. The interest of each stockholder consists in the right to a proportionate part of the profits whenever dividends are declared by the corporation, during its existence, under its charter, and to a like proportion of the property remaining, upon the termination or dissolution of the corporation, after payment of its debts.”\n[38]\nWe also agree with the ruling of the CA in its decision that the SEC (now the Regional Trial Court) had no jurisdiction over the cases filed in the court a quo.\nThe appellate court’s reliance in the assailed Resolution issued by the Board of Directors of the petitioner corporation, on Section 5(b) of P.D. No. 902, has no factual and legal basis.\nSection 5 of P.D. No. 902-A provides that the SEC\n[39]\nshall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving the following:\n(a) devices or schemes employed by, or any acts of, the board of directors, business associates, its officers or partners, amounting to fraud and misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholders, partners, members of association or organizations registered with the Commission, and\n(b) controversies arising out of intra-corporate  or partnership relations, between and among stockholders, members or associates; between any or all of them and the corporation, partnership or association of which they are stockholders, members or associates, respectively.\nIn Fabia v. Court of Appeals, [40]\nthe Court explained that Section 5 of P.D. No. 902-A should be taken in conjunction with Section 6 of the law.  It then proceeded to explain:\nIn synthesis, Sec. 5 of PD 902-A mandates that cases involving fraudulent actions and devices which are detrimental to the interest of stockholders, members or associates and directors of the corporation are  within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC.  Taken in conjunction with Sec. 6 of the same law, it will be gathered that the fraudulent acts/schemes which the SEC shall exclusively investigate and prosecute are those “in violation of any law or rules and regulations administered and enforced by the Commission” alone.  This investigative and prosecutorial powers of the SEC are further “without prejudice to any liability for violation of any provision of The Revised Penal Code.\n”\nFrom the foregoing, it can thus be concluded that the filing of the civil/intra-corporate case before the SEC does not preclude the simultaneous and concomitant filing of a criminal action before the regular courts; such that, a fraudulent act may give rise to liability for violation of the rules and regulations of the SEC cognizable by the SEC itself, as well as criminal liability for violation of the Revised Penal Code cognizable by the regular courts, both charges to be filed and proceeded independently, and may be simultaneously with the other.\n[41]\nThus, the filing of a petition in the SEC for the nullification of the Resolution of May 2, 1995 issued by the Chairman and two members of the Board of Directors of petitioner MPI, which authorized the filing of criminal cases against respondent Umezawa, was not a bar to his prosecution for estafa and qualified theft for his alleged fraudulent and delictual acts. The relationship of the party-litigants with each other or the position held by petitioner as a corporate officer in respondent MPI during the time he committed the crime becomes merely incidental and holds no bearing on jurisdiction. What is essential is that the fraudulent acts are likewise of a criminal nature and hence cognizable by the regular courts.\n[42]\nThus, notwithstanding the fact that respondent Umezawa was the president and general manager of petitioner MPI and a stockholder thereof, the latter may still be prosecuted for the crimes charged. The alleged fraudulent acts of respondent Umezawa in this case constitute the element of abuse of confidence, deceit or fraudulent means, and damage under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code on estafa.\n[43]\nWe agree with the encompassing disquisitions of the CA in its decision, to wit:\n… A dispute involving the corporation and its stockholders is not necessarily an intra-corporate dispute cognizable only by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Nor does it ipso facto negate the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court over the subject cases. The Supreme Court citing the case of Viray v. Court of Appeals\n(G.R. No. 92481, 191 SCRA 308 [1990]) in Torio v. Court of Appeals\n(G.R. No. 107293, March 2, 1994, 230 SCRA 626) held:\n“It should be obvious that not every conflict between a corporation and its stockholders involves corporate matters that only the SEC can resolve in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers.”\nAs the Supreme Court further ruled in the Torio case that\n“a contrary interpretation would distort the meaning and intent of P.D. 902-A, the law re-organizing the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The better policy in determining which body has jurisdiction over a case would be to consider not only the relationship of the parties but also the nature of the questions raised in the subject of the controversy.\n[44]\nOn the last issue, we find and so hold that the Informations state all the essential elements of estafa and qualified theft.  It was adequately alleged that respondent Umezawa, being the President and General Manager of petitioner MPI, stole and misappropriated the properties of his employer, more specifically, petitioner MPI.  As expostulated by the CA in its decision:\n… In any event, the allegations in the informations, if hypothetically admitted, are sufficient to bind Umezawa to the charges of qualified theft and estafa.\nAs aptly ruled by the court a quo in its Order of July 25, 1995, all the elements of the offense of qualified theft are present.  There is no basis for claiming otherwise.  Furthermore, the private offended party, as well as the subject matter of the felonious taking and the ownership thereof, have been adequately indicated or identified leaving no room for any doubt on these matters.\nConsidering that the motions to quash of September 30, 1998 are fundamentally rehash of the motion to quash filed on May 29, 1995 and the culpable acts subject of the new informations are virtually the same as the first information filed against Umezawa, there is no conceivable reason why the court a quo abandoned its previous stand and controverted itself in regard the sufficiency of the informations.\nIn our considered view, and as the court a quo had correctly held in its Order of May 26, 1996, “even a SEC ruling voiding the resolution authorizing the filing of criminal charges versus the accused Hajime Umezawa can have no bearing on the validity of the informations filed in these three criminal cases as pointed out by private complainant, the public offenses of qualified theft and estafa can [be] prosecuted de officio.”\nThe resolution of the office of the prosecutor on the preliminary investigation as well as the re-investigation conducted on the letter-complaint filed by private complainant company sufficiently established prima facie case against the accused and the legality or illegality of the constitution of the board which authorized the filing of the complaint does not materially affect either the informations filed against Umezawa or the pending criminal proceedings.  As petitioners contend, the action is now between the People of the Philippines and herein private respondent.\n[45]\nIN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING\n, the petitions are GRANTED.\nThe Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
