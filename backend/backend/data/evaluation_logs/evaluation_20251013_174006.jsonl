No. 132400 | 2005-01-31 | Ponente: TINGA, J.**\n\n**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari\n\n**Topic:** Labor Dispute and Injunction\n\n**Case Type:** Administrative matter\n\n**Doctrine:**\nThe prohibition against the issuance of injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, unless otherwise provided by law, is a fundamental principle that guides the court's decision in this case.\n\n**Ticker/Summary:**\nThe petitioners, Eduardo J. Mariño, Jr., Ma. Melvyn P. Alamis, and UST Faculty Union, filed a case against the respondents, Gil Gamilla, DuPont Aseron, and Justino Cardenas, involving a labor dispute and the issuance of an injunction. The Court of Appeals granted the respondents' petition and set aside the assailed orders, including the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondents. The case revolves around the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) over the subject matter and the validity of the election held by the UST Faculty Union.\n\n**Petitioner/s:** Eduardo J. Mariño, Jr., Ma. Melvyn P. Alamis, and UST Faculty Union | **Respondent/s:** Gil Gamilla, DuPont Aseron, and Justino Cardenas\n\n**Facts:**\n1) Sometime in May 1986, the UST Faculty Union (USTFU) entered into an initial collective bargaining agreement with the University of Santo Tomas (UST) wherein UST undertook to provide USTFU with a free office space at Room 302 of its Health Center Building.\n2) On 21 September 1996, the officers and directors of USTFU scheduled a general membership meeting on 5 October 1996 for the election of the union officers.\n3) On 4 October 1996, Med-Arbiter Tomas Falconitin issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) in Case No. NCR-OD-M-9610-001, enjoining the holding of the election of the USTFU officers and directors.\n4) On 5 March 1997, after petitioners as plaintiffs therein had posted the requisite bond, the RTC issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.\n\n**Petitioner's Contention:**\nNot stated in sources\n\n**Respondent's Contention:**\n1) The orders dated 3 and 5 March 1997 were void ab initio for lack of jurisdiction and on the ground that they were issued in violation of due process of law.\n2) The petitioners' cause of action in the complaint before the trial court is inextricably linked and intertwined with the issue of who are the legitimate officers of the USTFU.\n\n**RTC:** IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER\n- The RTC issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction requiring the respondents to remove the padlocks on the door of the UST Faculty Union office.\n\n**CA:** REVERSED\n- The Court of Appeals granted the respondents' petition and set aside the assailed orders, including the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, on the ground that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.\n\n**ISSUE/S:**\n- WHETHER OR NOT the RTC of Manila had jurisdiction over the subject matter of Civil Case No. 97-81928: NO\n- WHETHER OR NOT the petitioners' cause of action in the complaint before the trial court is inextricably linked and intertwined with the issue of who are the legitimate officers of the USTFU: YES\n\n**SC RULING:**\nThe Supreme Court applied the principle that the prohibition against the issuance of injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, unless otherwise provided by law, is a fundamental principle that guides the court's decision in this case. The Court also considered the fact that the petitioners' cause of action in the complaint before the trial court is inextricably linked and intertwined with the issue of who are the legitimate officers of the USTFU, which is a labor dispute. The Court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondents, granting their petition and setting aside the assailed orders.\n\n**DISPOSITIVE:** \nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED —and the assailed order (dated March 3, 1997) and the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction (dated March 5, 1997) SET ASIDE —and the respondent judge ordered to DISMISS Civil Case No. 97-81928.
