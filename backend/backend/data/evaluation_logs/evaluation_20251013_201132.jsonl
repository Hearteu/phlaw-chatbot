No. 147145 | 2005-01-31 | Ponente: CARPIO, J.**\n\n**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari\n\n**Topic:** Probate of Will\n\n**Case Type:** Civil case, specifically a probate case\n\n**Doctrine:**\nThe doctrine that a will executed prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code shall be governed by the laws in force at the time of its execution, specifically the Civil Code of 1889 and the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n**Ticker/Summary:**\nThe petitioners, Belinda Caponong-Noble, assailed the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Kabankalan, which admitted the will of Alipio Abada to probate. The core conflict revolves around the validity of the will due to alleged defects in its execution. The Court ultimately affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The outcome favored the respondents, Alipio Abaja and Noel Abellar, insofar as the will's admission to probate was concerned.\n\n**Petitioner/s:** Belinda Caponong-Noble | **Respondent/s:** Alipio Abaja and Noel Abellar\n\n**Facts:**\n1) Alipio Abada died sometime in May 1940, and his widow, Paula Toray, died in September 1943.\n2) Abada executed his will on 4 June 1932, under the laws in force at that time, which were the Civil Code of 1889 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190).\n3) The Regional Trial Court of Kabankalan ruled on the issue of whether the will of Abada had an attestation clause as required by law and admitted the will to probate.\n\n**Petitioner's Contention:**\n1) The petitioner argued that the will of Abada should not be admitted to probate due to alleged defects in its execution.\n2) The petitioner questioned the validity of the will, citing the lack of an attestation clause and other defects.\n\n**Respondent's Contention:**\n1) The respondents argued that the will of Abada was valid and should be admitted to probate.\n2) They contended that the will complied with the requirements of the applicable laws at the time of its execution.\n\n**RTC:** IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS\n- The RTC-Kabankalan properly admitted the will of Abada to probate, finding that it had an attestation clause as required by law.\n\n**CA:** AFFIRMED\n- The Court of Appeals affirmed the resolution of the RTC-Kabankalan, finding that the will of Abada was valid and properly admitted to probate.\n\n**ISSUE/S:**\n- WHETHER OR NOT the will of Abada should be admitted to probate: YES\n- WHETHER OR NOT the will of Abada has an attestation clause: YES\n- WHETHER OR NOT the will of Abada is valid despite alleged defects in its execution: YES\n\n**SC RULING:**\nThe Supreme Court applied the legal principle that a will executed prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code shall be governed by the laws in force at the time of its execution. The Court found that the will of Abada was executed in 1932 and was therefore governed by the Civil Code of 1889 and the Code of Civil Procedure. The Court held that the will complied with the requirements of these laws and was valid. The Court also found that the RTC-Kabankalan properly admitted the will to probate.\n\n**DISPOSITIVE:**\n\"WHEREFORE, we AFFIRM the Decision of the Court of Appeals of 12 January 2001 in CA-G.R.
